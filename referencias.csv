10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.019,,,Assessing the effects of gamification in the classroom,"Gamification, the application of game elements to non-game settings, continues to grow in popularity as a method to increase student engagement in the classroom. We tested students across two courses, measuring their motivation, social comparison, effort, satisfaction, learner empowerment, and academic performance at four points during a 16-week semester. One course received a gamified curriculum, featuring a leaderboard and badges, whereas the other course received the same curriculum without the gamified elements. Our results found that students in the gamified course showed less motivation, satisfaction, and empowerment over time than those in the non-gamified class. The effect of course type on students' final exam scores was mediated by students' levels of intrinsic motivation, with students in the gamified course showing less motivation and lower final exam scores than the non-gamified class. This suggests that some care should be taken when applying certain gamification mechanics to educational settings. Longitudinal study on effects of gamification in the classroom.71 students surveyed at four time points in gamified or non-gamified course.Over time, gamified students were less motivated, empowered, and satisfied.Gamified course negatively affected final exam grades through intrinsic motivation.Gamified systems strongly featuring rewards may have negative effects.","Abdallah Moubayed,MohammadNoor Injadat,Abdallah Shami,Hanan Lutfiyya",Computers in Education,2015
10.1016/j.chb.2015.03.036,,,Do badges increase user activity? A field experiment on the effects of gamification,"During recent years, the practice of adding game design to non-game services has gained a relatively large amount of attention. Popular discussion connects gamification to increased user engagement, service profitability, goal commitment and the overall betterment of various behavioral outcomes. However, there is still an absence of a coherent and ample body of empirical evidence that would confirm such expectations. To this end, this paper reports the results of a 2year (1+1year between-group) field experiment in gamifying a service by implementing a game mechanic called badges. During the experiment a pre-implementation group (N=1410) was monitored for 1year. After the implementation, the post-implementation (the gamified condition) group (N=1579) was monitored for another full year. Results show that users in the gamified condition were significantly more likely to post trade proposals, carry out transactions, comment on proposals and generally use the service in a more active way. Effects of gamification on user activity are studied in a sharing economy service.Pre-implementation group (N=1410) was followed for 1year before the implementation.Post-implementation group (N=1579) was followed for 1year after the implementation.We compared trade listings, transactions, social interaction and total activity.The results show significant positive effect on all of the four dependent variables.","Abelardo Pardo,Carlos Delgado Kloos",Computers in Human Behavior,2017
10.3115/v1/w14-4111,,,Predicting MOOC Dropout over Weeks Using Machine Learning Methods,"With high dropout rates as observed in many current larger-scale online courses, mechanisms that are able to predict student dropout become increasingly important. While this problem is partially solved for students that are active in online forums, this is not yet the case for the more general student population. In this paper, we present an approach that works on click-stream data. Among other features, the machine learning algorithm takes the weekly history of student data into account and thus is able to notice changes in student behavior over time. In the later phases of a course (i.e., once such history data is available), this approach is able to predict dropout significantly better than baseline methods.","Abelardo Pardo,Feifei Han,Robert A.

10.7763/ijiet.2016.v6.699,,,An Online Automated Scoring System for Java Programming Assignments,"Abstract—This paper proposes a web-based system that automatically scores programming assignments for students. The system receives a Java application program submitted by a student and returns the test result immediately. The test consists of compiler check, JUnit test, and result test. The result test is very useful for students in elementary programming courses, because a typical program is composed of only a main method that reads/writes data from/to the standard input/output devices. The system is used experimentally in an actual course of our university. We confirmed that the accuracy of scoring is very high and the response time of the system is satisfactory.","Abhinava Barthakur,Vitomir Kovanovic,Vitomir Kovanović,Maarten de Laat,Srećko Joksimović,Srecko Joksimovic,George Siemens,George Siemens,George Siemens,Michael Richey,Michael Richey,Michael Richey,Shane Dawson",International Journal of Information and Education Technology,2016
10.1016/j.chb.2016.12.053,,,Exploring how individual traits influence enjoyment in a mobile learning game,"This study investigated individual traits as predictors of game enjoyment by including learning style, intrinsic motivation, collaboration skills, and computer game attitude as key parts of a model that also included achievement. Results of correlation and regression analyses revealed that intrinsic motivation was the only variable to predict game enjoyment. This supports the conceptualization of enjoyment as need satisfaction of intrinsic needs. Enjoyment was also found to be positively correlated with achievement. Other significant relations emerged, particularly how a player's attitude toward games predicted intrinsic motivation. The present study examined children's enjoyment experiences in the mobile version of the Minecraft game. It also highlights the complexity of game enjoyment as it relates to mobile learning games. Students who have more positive attitudes toward a game are more intrinsically motivated to play.The level of enjoyment experienced in a mobile game is accounted for by the player's level of intrinsic motivation.In the context of mobile learning games, a student's learning style is not linked to enjoyment or achievement.Collaboration skills and enjoyment levels can predict achievement.","Adam S.

10.23919/mipro.2017.7973515,,,Introducing gamification into e-learning university courses,"Research on educational e-courses that contain only a series of motivating elements of computer games but do not include playing computer games has intensified since 2010 [1] [6]. This field of research is called gamification and represents the use of game elements (mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics) in a field (education, marketing etc.) that is not a computer game. A review of literature related to the field of teaching with online courses in information technology (e.g. programming, software engineering) shows that the topic of gamification has so far been inadequately explored, with the lack of theoretical and empirical research that would involve gamification methodology. Previous studies have shown that gamification can have a positive impact on the pedagogical and psychological aspects of e-learning. In this paper empirical research is presented regarding the use of gamification in online teaching of programming. A gamified e-course was designed for the lectures in programming, and a possible positive effect was examined on the usage of learning materials in an experimental group of students who will use a gamified e-course (online system).","Adam S.

The paper describes a framework of microlearning-based training mobile application for improving programming skills, which will integrate the advantages of the web-based learning environments and benefits of microlearning approach into the existing virtual learning environment infrastructure of the educational organization. The proposed mobile application framework implements innovative methods based on microlearning approach, learning anytime and anywhere requirements with immediate feedback, creating the learning community, and applying gamification features. These innovations are designed to address the interests, learning and communication habits of young people, with the goals to develop their internal motivation and sustain their interest in acquiring required programming skills.","Adam S.

10.1145/3151759.3151795,,,Gamification in mobile and workplace integrated microlearning,"Business analysts and human resource executives consider MicroLearning and Gamification as two of the currently hottest topics in corporate learning and workplace learning. MicroLearning is seen as a solution for the limitations in dedicated learning time of employees, already stressed in their daily work routines. Gamification fosters users engagement and creates higher intrinsic motivation to learn. In this case study, we report and analyze the learning behavior of 175 employees using gamified MicroLearning over the course of seven months. The study setup allows observing behavior with and without the extrinsic motivation of an employee competition. While we observe a large increase in activity compared to groups studied in previous work, we did not see an increase in the amount of average daily learning sessions. However, we could identify a shift in learning times from working hours towards high attention periods in evenings and weekends. Consequently, we regard gamification as a means to raise user engagement, which yet bears challenges for the deployment in corporate environments to shape learning behavior as intended.","Alaaeddin Swidan,Alexander Serebrenik,Felienne Hermans",,2017
10.18608/jla.2018.51.7,,,A Modular and Extensible Framework for Open Learning Analytics,"Open Learning Analytics (OLA) is an emerging concept in the field of Learning Analytics (LA). It deals with learning data collected from multiple environments and contexts, analyzed with a wide range of analytics methods to address the requirements of different stakeholders. Due to this diversity in different dimensions of OLA, the LA developers and researchers face numerous challenges while designing solutions for OLA. The Open Learning Analytics Platform (OpenLAP) is a framework that addresses these issues and lays the foundation for an ecosystem of OLA that aims at supporting learning and teaching in fragmented, diverse, and networked learning environments. It follows a user-centric approach to engage end users in flexible definition and dynamic generation of personalized indicators. In this paper, we address a subset of OLA challenges and present the conceptual and implementation details of the analytics framework component of OpenLAP, which follows a flexible architecture that allows the easy integration of new analytics methods and visualization techniques in OpenLAP to support end users in defining indicators based on their needs in order to embed the results into their personal learning environment.","Alan L.

10.1109/educon.2019.8725139,,,A Knowledge Based System for Automated Assessment of Short Structured Questions,"Assessment is a key tool of the educational system to gauge the level of understanding of students. Assessment is traditionally carried out through various mediums ranging from written evaluations to oral evaluations or even through practical sessions in some cases. Over the years, it has been noticed that the level of education is escalating and that academic competition is growing fiercer. Thus, educational institutes are faced with the need to upgrade their process of assessment. Although assessment is an essential part of the educational process, the correction of structured questions represents a substantial portion of an instructor’s worktime. Besides, with the increase in cohort size throughout institutions and the popularity of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), this problem seems to worsen. Teachers are therefore faced with a conundrum; they can either devote their time to the correction of scripts or to teaching activities. According to research, computerized marking give rise to faster correction and it saves staff time in terms of supervising and marking. In this context, a knowledge based automated assessment system has been developed to help correction and grading of short structured questions online. The system will compare the meaning of two sentences by taking into account both semantic and syntactic content and the corresponding grade will be returned.","Alejandro Andrade,Joshua A.

The primary goal of three years of research is to uncover the role of a few types of activities, especially the purpose of an automated assessment. Despite the education systems function supported the automated assessment of source code is one of the most useful tools of programming learning, there are only a few researches inspected its effectiveness and impact. The paper compares involved groups of students, their motivation and expectations collected via a set of questionnaires. It investigates the significance of automated assessment of source code in the educational process. The results show significant differences between groups with and without the use of automated assessment were not proven. Finally, the authors researched the relationship between the number of solved tasks and the student’s outcomes of the evaluation and identified a positive correlation.","Alexis Gabadinho,Gilbert Ritschard,Nicolas S.

With this in mind, we present a methodology for creating a set of descriptors of the students’ progression based on their coding styles as captured by different non-semantic and semantic features of their code submissions. Preliminary findings show that these descriptors extracted from a single assignment can be used to predict whether or not a student got help throughout the entire quarter. Based on these findings, we plan on developing a model of the impact of teacher intervention on a student’s pathway through homework assignments.","Allan Fowler,Anders Drachen,Johanna Pirker,Ian Pollock,Bruno Campagnola de Paula,María Emilia Echeveste,Marcos J.

This computational model that we propose has been integrated into the architecture of a Belief-Desire-Intention artificial agent so that this can autonomously select relevant, interesting information of the (external or internal) environment while ignoring other less relevant information. The advantage is that the agent can communicate only that interesting, selective information to its processing resources (focus of the senses, decision-making, etc.) or to its human owner's processing resources so that these resources can be allocated more effectively. We provide both theoretical and empirical arguments for that computational model.","Allan Wigfield,Jacquelynne S. Eccles",,2013

This paper presents an overview of the architectural design including state-of-the-art web-based distributed architecture, the AI techniques used, and the programmer-optimized user interface. This project is a prototype being constructed which will model the domain of a small subset of the Java programming language in a very specific context. Research is in progress and it is hypothesized that the completed prototype will be sufficient to prove the concept and that a fully developed Java Intelligent Tutoring System will provide an interactively-rich learning environment for students that will result in increased achievement. Based on the success of similar Intelligent Tutoring Systems, it is also hypothesized that these students will be able to learn programming skills and gain knowledge more quickly and effectively than students in traditional educational settings.","Allison Elliott Tew,Mark Guzdial",Advanced Technology for Learning,2004

Although relevant research exists across several disciplines including education and cognitive science, disciplinary differences have made this material inaccessible to many computing educators. Furthermore, computer science instructors have not had access to a comprehensive survey of research in this area. This paper collects and classifies this literature, identifies important work and mediates it to computing educators and professional bodies.   We identify research that gives well-supported advice to computing academics teaching introductory programming. Limitations and areas of incomplete coverage of existing research efforts are also identified.

10.1080/00461520.2011.611369,,,"The Relative Effectiveness of Human Tutoring, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, and Other Tutoring Systems","This article is a review of experiments comparing the effectiveness of human tutoring, computer tutoring, and no tutoring. “No tutoring” refers to instruction that teaches the same content without tutoring. The computer tutoring systems were divided by their granularity of the user interface interaction into answer-based, step-based, and substep-based tutoring systems. Most intelligent tutoring systems have step-based or substep-based granularities of interaction, whereas most other tutoring systems (often called CAI, CBT, or CAL systems) have answer-based user interfaces. It is widely believed as the granularity of tutoring decreases, the effectiveness increases. In particular, when compared to No tutoring, the effect sizes of answer-based tutoring systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and adult human tutors are believed to be d = 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 respectively. This review did not confirm these beliefs. Instead, it found that the effect size of human tutoring was much lower: d = 0.79. Moreover, the eff...","Allyson F. Hadwin,John C.

Over the course of nine weeks, students completed five different graded programming exercises in a computer lab. Using an instrumented version of BlueJ, an integrated development environment for Java, we collected novice compilations and explored the errors novices encountered, the locations of these errors, and the frequency with which novices compiled their programs. We identified which frequently encountered errors and which compilation behaviors were characteristic of at-risk students. Based on these findings, we developed linear regression models that allowed prediction of students' scores on a midterm exam. However, the models derived could not accurately predict the at-risk students. Although our goal of identifying at-risk students was not attained, we have gained insights regarding the compilation behavior of our students, which may help us identify students who are in need of intervention.","Amjad Altadmri,Neil C.

10.1145/2189835.2189851,,,Beyond curriculum: the exploring computer science program,"➧1 In the past few decades, computer science has driven innovation across a variety of academic fields and become a robust part of democratic participation and the labor economy. Today’s youth are surrounded with applications of these new technologies that affect how they access and produce information and communicate with friends, family, and educators. Yet, though students often gain skills as “users” of these technologies in schools, too many have been denied opportunities to study computer science and produce new knowledge required to become “creators” of computing innovations. The students who do study computer science courses often represent only a narrow band of students that excludes significant numbers of girls and students of color. Further, for a field that depends on creativity, a homogenous workforce fails to take advantage of those with diverse experiences and world viewpoints that likely foster divergent and fresh thinking. This article will provide an overview of Exploring Computer Science (ECS), a curriculum and program developed to broaden participation in computing for high school students in the Los Angeles Unified School District. This program is framed around a three-pronged approach to reform: curricular development, teacher professional development, and policy work across a variety of educational institutions. The focus is to provide the necessary structures and support to schools and teachers that leads to high quality teaching and learning in computer science classrooms. In ECS classrooms, high quality teaching and learning is viewed within the frame of inquiry-based teaching strategies that lead to deep student content learning and engagement. The incorporation of equity-based teaching practices is an essential part of setting up the classroom culture that facilitates inquiry-based learning. As the second largest and one of the most diverse districts in the United States, the Los Angeles Unified School District provides an important context to understand opportunities and obstacles encountered while engaging in institutional K-12 computer science education reform. This article will begin with an account of the educational research that provided key information about the obstacles students encounter in computer science classrooms. Next, we will describe the key elements of the ECS program. Finally, we will highlight several lessons that we have learned that inform the CS 10K campaign (see Jan Cuny’s Critical Perspective “Transforming High School Computing: A Call to Action”, this issue).","Andreas Grillenberger,Ralf Romeike",ACM Inroads,2012

In an effort to understand how tools like Scratch and Blockly differ from more conventional text-based introductory programming languages with respect to conceptual understanding, we developed a set of ""commutative"" assessments. Each multiple-choice question on the assessment includes a short program that can be displayed in either a blocks- based or text-based form. The set of potential answers for each question includes the correct answer along with choices informed by prior research on novice programming misconceptions. In this paper we introduce the Commutative Assessment, discuss the theoretical and practical motivations for the assessment, and present findings from a study that used the assessment. The study had 90 high school students take the assessment at three points over the course of the first ten weeks of an introduction to programming course, alternating the modality (blocks vs. text) for each question over the course of the three administrations of the assessment. Our analysis reveals differences on performance between blocks-based and text-based questions as well as differences in the frequency of misconceptions based on the modality.

The present work aims to refine the understanding of this phenomenon by using in-class clicker questions as a source of student performance. Clicker questions generate per-lecture and per-question data with which to assess student understanding. This work demonstrates that clicker question performance early in the term predicts student outcomes at the end of the term. The predictive nature of these questions applies to code-writing questions, multiple choice questions, and the final exam as a whole. The most predictive clicker questions are identified and the relationships between these questions and final exam performance are examined.","Andy Phippen,L. Sheppard,Steven Furnell",,2014

Although all MOOCs have in common their scale and free access, they have already bifurcated in two very distinct types of courses when compared in terms of their underpinning theory, format and structure, known as c-MOOCs and x-MOOCs. The concept of openness behind each of the formats is also very different. Previous studies have shown that c-and x-MOOCs share some common features but that they clearly differ on the learning theory and pedagogical model on which they stand. In this paper we extend earlier findings and concentrate on the concept of “openness” behind each format showing important differences.","Anna Corazza,Valerio Maggio,Valerio Maggio,Giuseppe Scanniello",Open Praxis,2013

We find that each student's average level of frustration across five lab exercises can be detected based on the number of pairs of consecutive compilations with the same edit location, the number of pairs of consecutive compilations with the same error, the average time between compilations and the total number of errors. Attempts to detect frustration at a finer grain-size, identifying individual students' fluctuations in frustration between labs, were less successful. These results indicate that it is possible to detect frustration at a coarse-grained level, solely from coarse-grained data about students' behavior within a learning environment.","Anna Karen Gárate-Escamila,Amir Hajjam El Hassani,Emmanuel Andrès",,2009

The study of a program's execution, known as dynamic analysis, has become a common technique in this respect and has received substantial attention from the research community, particularly over the last decade. These efforts have resulted in a large research body of which currently there exists no comprehensive overview. This paper reports on a systematic literature survey aimed at the identification and structuring of research on program comprehension through dynamic analysis. From a research body consisting of 4,795 articles published in 14 relevant venues between July 1999 and June 2008 and the references therein, we have systematically selected 176 articles and characterized them in terms of four main facets: activity, target, method, and evaluation. The resulting overview offers insight in what constitutes the main contributions of the field, supports the task of identifying gaps and opportunities, and has motivated our discussion of several important research directions that merit additional consideration in the near future.","Anouk Donker,H. de Boer,Danny Kostons,C.C.

However, MOOCs attract a diverse range of learners, each with different motivations and prior experience. This study investigates the self-regulated learning (SRL) learners apply in a MOOC, in particular focusing on how learners' motivations for taking a MOOC influence their behaviour and employment of SRL strategies. Following a quantitative investigation of the learning behaviours of 788 MOOC participants, follow-up interviews were conducted with 32 learners. The study compares the narrative descriptions of behaviour between learners with self-reported high and low SRL scores. Substantial differences were detected between the self-described learning behaviours of these two groups in five of the sub-processes examined. Learners' motivations and goals were found to shape how they conceptualised the purpose of the MOOC, which in turn affected their perception of the learning process.",Anthony A.

If such background information could be automatically distilled from students' working process, additional guidance and support mechanisms could be provided even to those, who do not wish to disclose such information. In this study, we explore methods for automatically distinguishing novice programmers from more experienced programmers using fine-grained source code snapshot data. We approach the issue by partially replicating a previous study that used students' keystroke latencies as a proxy to introductory programming course outcomes, and follow this by an exploration of machine learning methods to separate those students with little to no previous programming experience from those with more experience. Our results confirm that students' keystroke latencies can be used as a metric for measuring course outcomes. At the same time, our results show that students programming experience can be identified to some extent from keystroke latency data, which means that such data has potential as a source of information for customizing the students' learning experience.",Anthony G.

It is termed CAMEO Copying Answers using Multiple Existence Online. A person using CAMEO sets up one or more harvesting accounts for collecting correct answers; these are then submitted in the user's master account for credit.The study has three main goals: Determining the prevalence of CAMEO, studying its detailed characteristics, and inferring the motivation(s) for using it. For the physics course that we studied, about 10% of the certificate earners used this method to obtain more than 1% of their correct answers, and more than 3% of the certificate earners used it to obtain the majority (>50%) of their correct answers. We discuss two of the likely consequences of CAMEO: jeopardizing the value of MOOC certificates as academic credentials, and generating misleading conclusions in educational research. Based on our study, we suggest methods for reducing CAMEO. Although this study was conducted on a MOOC, CAMEO can be used in any learning environment that enables students to have multiple accounts. Studying the use of multiple accounts for harvesting solutions in a MOOCs.10% of the certificate earners used it to some extent; 3% for the majority of their points.Motivation is earning a certificate with less effort.This behavior is typically premediated, applied without attempting to solve the question legitimately first.Randomizing question parameters and delaying feedback reduce it significantly.",Anthony Robins,Computers in Education,2017

In this work, based on a thorough qualitative study of students' behaviors recorded in two MOOC courses with large student enrollments, we develop a non-parametric Bayesian model to capture students' sequential learning activities in a generative manner. Homogeneity of students' learning behaviors is captured by clustering them into latent student groups, where shared model structure characterizes the transitional patterns, intensity and temporal distribution of their learning activities. In the meanwhile, heterogeneity is captured by clustering students into different groups. Both qualitative and quantitative studies on those two MOOC courses confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed model in identifying students' learning behavior patterns and clustering them into related groups for predictive analysis. The identified student groups accurately predict student retention, course satisfaction and demographics.","Anthony Robins,Janet Rountree,Nathan Rountree",,2017

We critically survey work across each category, providing data on the raw data source, feature engineering, statistical model, evaluation method, prediction architecture, and other aspects of these experiments. Such a review is particularly useful given the rapid expansion of predictive modeling research in MOOCs since the emergence of major MOOC platforms in 2012. This survey reveals several key methodological gaps, which include extensive filtering of experimental subpopulations, ineffective student model evaluation, and the use of experimental data which would be unavailable for real-world student success prediction and intervention, which is the ultimate goal of such models. Finally, we highlight opportunities for future research, which include temporal modeling, research bridging predictive and explanatory student models, work which contributes to learning theory, and evaluating long-term learner success in MOOCs.","António José Mendes,Luís Paquete,Amílcar Cardoso,Anabela Gomes",User Modeling and User-adapted Interaction,2018

With Fake Learners, They Might Not Be!","The rich data that Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platforms collect on the behavior of millions of users provide a unique opportunity to study human learning and to develop data-driven methods that can address the needs of individual learners. This type of research falls into the emerging field of learning analytics. However, learning analytics research tends to ignore the issue of the reliability of results that are based on MOOCs data, which is typically noisy and generated by a largely anonymous crowd of learners. This paper provides evidence that learning analytics in MOOCs can be significantly biased by users who abuse the anonymity and open-nature of MOOCs, for example by setting up multiple accounts, due to their amount and aberrant behavior. We identify these users, denoted fake learners, using dedicated algorithms. The methodology for measuring the bias caused by fake learners’ activity combines the ideas of Replication Research and Sensitivity Analysis. We replicate two highly-cited learning analytics studies with and without fake learners data, and compare the results. While in one study, the results were relatively stable against fake learners, in the other, removing the fake learners’ data significantly changed the results. These findings raise concerns regarding the reliability of learning analytics in MOOCs, and highlight the need to develop more robust, generalizable and verifiable research methods.","Arnold Pears,Stephen Seidman,Stephen B.

In applying survival analysis to a sample of more than 20,000 participants from one popular computer science MOOC, we found that students' precomputational thinking skills and their perseverance in assignment submission strongly predict their persistence in the MOOC. Moreover, we discovered that precomputational thinking skills, programming experience, and gender, which were previously considered to be constant predictors of students' retention, have effects that attenuate over the course milestones. This finding suggests that MOOC educators should take a growth perspective towards students' persistence: As students overcome the initial hurdles, their resilience grows stronger.","Arto Vihavainen,Juha Helminen,Petri Ihantola",Journal of Computer Assisted Learning,2020

However, studies on predictive learning analytics in the context of blended learning remain relatively scarce compared to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), where such applications have gained a strong foothold. Data sets obtained from blended learning environments suffer from a high dimensionality and typically expose a limited number of instances, which makes predictive analysis a challenging task. In this work, we explore the log data of a master-level blended course to predict the students' grades based entirely on the data obtained from an online module (a small private online course), using and comparing logistic regression and random forest-based predictive models. The results of the analysis show that, despite the limited data, success vs. fail predictions can be made as early as in the middle of the course. This could be used in the future for timely interventions, both for failure prevention as well as for reinforcing positive learning behaviours of students.","Asraful Alam Pathan,Mehedi Hasan,Md.

Accordingly, applying this distinction into appearance and normative goals alongside mastery goals, this study explores what kinds of achievement goal orientation profiles are identified among over 2000 students participating in an introductory programming MOOC. Using Two-Step cluster analysis, five distinct motivational profiles are identified. Course performance and demographics of students with different goal orientation profiles are mostly similar. Students with Combined Mastery and Performance Goals perform slightly better than students with Low Goals. The observations are largely in line with previous studies conducted in different contexts. The differentiation of appearance and normative performance goals seemed to yield meaningful motivational profiles, but further studies are needed to establish their relevance and investigate whether this information can be used to improve teaching.","Awatef Hicheur Cairns,Billel Gueni,Mehdi Fhima,Andrew Cairns,Stephane David,Nasser Khelifa,Nasser Khelifa,Paul Dautier",,2020

For this, a pilot coding education support system based on Levenshtein distance algorithm which shows learners’ progress to given solution in real-time was developed in order to help learners to solve complex problems easily, and the learners’ motivation and self-efficacy was measured for estimating the usefulness of developed system targeting elementary school students. When the learners use the developed system, it was found that a statistically significant difference appears in the sub-factors of learning motivation compared with traditional class teaching environments.

Analysis of clickstreams shows how a Web site is navigated and used by its visitors. Clickstream data of online stores contains information useful for understanding the effectiveness of marketing and merchandising efforts, such as how customers find the store, what products they see, and what products they purchase. In this paper, we present an interactive visualization system that provides users with greater abilities to interpret and explore clickstream data of online stores. This system visualizes the effectiveness of Web merchandising from two different points of view by using two different visualization techniques: visualization of sessions by using parallel coordinates and visualization of product performance by using starfield graphs. Furthermore, this system provides facilities for zooming, filtering, color-coding, dynamic querying and data sampling. It also provides summary information along with visualizations, and by maintaining a connection between visualizations and the source database, it dynamically updates the summary information. To demonstrate how the presented visualization system provides capabilities for examining online store clickstreams, we present a series of parallel coordinates and starfield visualizations that display clickstream data from an operating online retail store. A framework for understanding Web merchandising is briefly explained. A set of metrics referred to as i>micro-conversion rates, which are defined for Web merchandising analysis in our previous work (Lee et al., Electronic Markets, 2000), is also explained and used for the visualizations of online store effectiveness.","Brian Harvey,Daniel D.

We suggest that EDM may have the potential to support research that is meaningful and useful both to researchers working actively in the constructionist tradition but also to wider communities. Finally, we explore potential collaborations between researchers in the EDM and constructionist traditions; such collaborations have the potential to enhance the ability of constructionist researchers to make rich inferences about learning and learners, while providing EDM researchers with many interesting new research questions and challenges.","Cecilia Martínez,Marcos J.

The proposed REACT (Real Time Evaluation and Assessment of Computational Thinking) system is a first step toward allowing teachers to see which high-level concepts students have mastered and which ones they are struggling with as students code in real time. REACT supports and facilitates the teaching of 21st century computing skills such as computational thinking [1] in the classroom environment.","Chao-Ying Joanne Peng,Kuk Lida Lee,Gary M.

10.1145/2674683.2674692,,,How novices tackle their first lines of code in an IDE: analysis of programming session traces,"While computing educators have put plenty of effort into researching and developing programming environments that make it easier for students to create their first programs, these tools often have only little resemblance with the tools used in the industry. We report on a study, where students with no previous programming experience started to program directly using an industry strength programming environment. The programming environment was augmented with logging capability that recorded every keystroke and event within the system, which provided a view on how the novices tackle their first lines of code. Our results show that while at first, the students struggle with syntax -- as is typical with learning a new language -- no evidence can be found that suggests that learning to use the programming environment is hard. In a two-week period, the students learned to use the basic features of the programming environment such as specific shortcuts. Although we observed students using copy-paste-programming relatively often, most of the pasted code is from their own previous work. Finally, when considering the compilation errors and error distributions, we hypothesize that the errors are a product of three factors; the exercises, the environment, and the data logging granularity.","Charles R Harris,K.

Based on this experience, the paper argues that web traffic analysis provides an interesting and useful set of procedures for learning about consumers' navigational paths through companies' web sites. Once these navigational paths have been logged and analyzed, it is then possible to determine how web site visitors—both new prospects and returning customers—react to marketing offers online. Web traffic analysis offers a variety of metrics that can be used to evaluate web sites, and intelligent executives can then modify these web sites in ways that improve visitor response. The paper demonstrates how web traffic analysis fits into the academic literature in marketing, and a number of software and web metrics issues are presented. An illustration is used to demonstrate some of the ways in which web traffic analysis can be used to drive customer acquisition and customer retention programs in marketing.","Chen Chen,Chen Chen,Chen Chen,Chen Chen,Gerhard Sonnert,Philip M.

The model synthesizes measurable evidence from student work with broader, more abstract coding design patterns, which are then mapped onto computational thinking concepts.   We present the results of a pilot-test study of the PECT Model in order to demonstrate its potential efficacy in detecting both differences in computational thinking among students of various ages as well as any clear overall progressions in increasing computational sophistication. Results of this sort are vital for establishing research-based and age-appropriate curricula for students in the primary grades, i.e., developing non-trivial, challenging but not overly daunting lesson plans that utilize the cognitive development stage of each grade level most effectively.","Chengjiu Yin,Fumiya Okubo,Atsushi Shimada,Misato Oi,Sachio Hirokawa,Hiroaki Ogata,Hiroaki Ogata",,2013

During an online experiment, subjects were asked to perform a shopping task on a website offering product recommendations. Significant differences were observed between subjects' decision-making process and their online shopping behavior. Subjects who did not consult a product recommendation had a significantly less complex online shopping behavior (e.g., fewer web pages viewed) than subjects who consulted the product recommendation. Surprisingly, no differences were found between the online shopping behavior of subjects who consulted but did not follow the product recommendation and subjects who consulted and followed the product recommendation. Managerial and theoretical implications of these results are provided.","Chris A. Boulton,Carmel Kent,Hywel T. P. Williams",Journal of Business Research,2005

Our analysis focused on the activity of 24 dyads on a 3 week assignment. We correlated frequencies of events such as use of code generation and of the debugger with assignment grades, final exam grades, and the difference in rankings within dyad on the final exam. Our results show several significant correlations. In particular, code generation and debugging are correlated with the final grade, and running in non-debug mode is correlated with differences in ranking. These results are encouraging as they show that it is possible to predict learning outcomes with simple frequency data and suggest more complex indicators could achieve robust prediction.","Chris Piech,Jonathan Huang,Andy Nguyen,Mike Phulsuksombati,Mehran Sahami,Leonidas J.

The effect of repeated exposures to banner ads is negative and nonlinear, and the differential effect of each successive ad exposure is initially negative, though nonlinear, and levels off at higher levels of passive ad exposures. Further, significant correlations between session and consumer click proneness and banner exposure sensitivity suggest gains from repeated banner exposures when consumers are less click prone. For a particular number of sessions, more clicks are generated from consumers who revisit over a longer period of time, than for those with the same number of sessions in a relatively shorter timeframe. We also find that consumers are equally likely to click on banner ads placed early or late in navigation path and that exposures have a positive cumulative effect in inducing click-through in future sessions. Our results have implications for online advertising response measurement and dynamic ad placement, and may help guide advertising media placement decisions.","Christiane Gresse von Wangenheim,Jean Carlo Rossa Hauck,Matheus Faustino Demetrio,Rafael Pelle,Nathalia da Cruz Alves,Heliziane Barbosa,Luiz Felipe Azevedo",Marketing Science,2003

We show how path information can be categorized and modeled using a dynamic multinomial probit model of Web browsing. We estimate this model using data from a major online bookseller. Our results show that the memory component of the model is crucial in accurately predicting a path. In comparison, traditional multinomial probit and first-order Markov models predict paths poorly. These results suggest that paths may reflect a user's goals, which could be helpful in predicting future movements at a website. One potential application of our model is to predict purchase conversion. We find that after only six viewings purchasers can be predicted with more than 40% accuracy, which is much better than the benchmark 7% purchase conversion prediction rate made without path information. This technique could be used to personalize Web designs and product offerings based upon a user's path.","Christoph Frädrich,Florian Obermüller,Nina Körber,Ute Heuer,Gordon Fraser",Marketing Science,2004

The StuBehEduInfo dataset contains student behavioural and past educational attributes. The QuickTestInfo dataset contains simple C programming questions. Then using these datasets we built two decision trees that can classify the students into three groups (Good, Average, & poor), so we can take extra care of the weakest students. The proposed decision tree models can correctly classify 87% students.","Christopher Watson,Christopher Watson,Frederick W. B. Li,Jamie L. Godwin",,2014

There is, therefore, a growing need to measure students’ learning of CT in the context of programming and also support all learners through this process of learning computational problem solving. The goal of this research is to explore hypothesis-driven approaches that can be combined with data-driven ones to better interpret student actions and processes in log data captured from block-based programming environments with the goal of measuring and assessing students’ CT skills. Informed by past literature and based on our empirical work examining a dataset from the use of the Fairy Assessment in the Alice programming environment in middle schools, we present a framework that formalizes a process where a hypothesis-driven approach informed by Evidence-Centered Design effectively complements data-driven learning analytics in interpreting students’ programming process and assessing CT in block-based programming environments. We apply the framework to the design of Alice tasks for high school CS to be used for measuring CT during programming.","Congshu Li,Lixia Liu,Weitong Pan,Yanmei Chen,Xuefang Shang,Yingling Wang,Tian-Yun Wang,Xiufang Xu",ACM Transactions on Computing Education,2017

Visualizing the clickstream data has gained significant importance in many applications like web marketing, customer prediction, product management, etc. Most existing works employ different tools for visualizing along with techniques like Markov chain modelling. However the accuracy of the methods can be improved when the shortcomings are resolved. Markov chain modelling has problems of occlusion and unable to provide clear display of data visualizing. These issues can be resolved by improving the Markov chain model by introducing a heuristic method of Kolmogorov– Smirnov distance and maximum likelihood estimator for visualizing. These concepts are employed between the underlying distribution states to minimize the Markov distribution. The proposed model named as WebClickviz is performed in Hadoop Apache Flume which is a highly advanced tool. The clickstream data visualization accuracy can be improved when Apache Flume tools are used. The performance evaluation are made on a specific website clickstream data which shows the proposed model of visualization has better performance than existing models like VizClick.","CooperStephen,DannWanda,PauschRandy",,2017

However, many users have ongoing information needs. For example, you might need to track developments in  multicore computer chips . One way of doing this is to issue the query multicore  and  computer  and  chip against an index of recent newswire articles each morning. In this and the following two chapters we examine the question: How can this repetitive task be automated? To this end, many systems support  standing queries . A standing query is like any other query except that it is periodically executed on a collection to which new documents are incrementally added over time.  If your standing query is just multicore  and  computer  and  chip, you will tend to miss many relevant new articles which use other terms such as  multicore processors . To achieve good recall, standing queries thus have to be refined over time and can gradually become quite complex. In this example, using a Boolean search engine with stemming, you might end up with a query like (multicore  or  multi-core)  and  (chip  or  processor  or  microprocessor).  To capture the generality and scope of the problem space to which standing queries belong, we now introduce the general notion of a  classification  problem. Given a set of  classes , we seek to determine which class(es) a given object belongs to.","Dale Parsons,Patricia Haden",,2008

,,,A neural probabilistic language model,"A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.","Daniel Conroy-Beam,David M.

10.1145/2635868.2635883,,,Learning natural coding conventions,"Every programmer has a characteristic style, ranging from preferences about identifier naming to preferences about object relationships and design patterns. Coding conventions define a consistent syntactic style, fostering readability and hence maintainability. When collaborating, programmers strive to obey a project’s coding conventions. However, one third of reviews of changes contain feedback about coding conventions, indicating that programmers do not always follow them and that project members care deeply about adherence. Unfortunately, programmers are often unaware of coding conventions because inferring them requires a global view, one that aggregates the many local decisions programmers make and identifies emergent consensus on style. We present NATURALIZE, a framework that learns the style of a codebase, and suggests revisions to improve stylistic consistency. NATURALIZE builds on recent work in applying statistical natural language processing to source code. We apply NATURALIZE to suggest natural identifier names and formatting conventions. We present four tools focused on ensuring natural code during development and release management, including code review. NATURALIZE achieves 94 % accuracy in its top suggestions for identifier names.

We design a simple and scalable static analysis that extracts sequences of method calls from a large codebase, and index these into a statistical language model. We then employ the language model to find the highest ranked sentences, and use them to synthesize a code completion. Our approach is able to synthesize sequences of calls across multiple objects together with their arguments.   Experiments show that our approach is fast and effective.

An approach based on space density computations is used to choose an optimum indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents. Typical evaluation results are shown, demonstating the usefulness of the model.",David Andrich,Communications of The ACM,1975
10.1504/ijlt.2014.065752,,,Example-based feedback provision using structured solution spaces,"Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) typically rely on a formalised model of the underlying domain knowledge in order to provide feedback to learners adaptively to their needs. This approach implies two general drawbacks: the formalisation of a domain-specific model usually requires a huge effort, and in some domains it is not possible at all. In this paper, we propose feedback provision strategies in absence of a formalised domain model, motivated by example-based learning approaches. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of these strategies in several studies with experts and students. We discuss how, in a set of solutions, appropriate examples can be automatically identified and assigned to given student solutions via machine learning techniques in conjunction with an underlying dissimilarity metric. The plausibility of such an automatic selection is evaluated in an expert survey, while possible choices for domain-agnostic dissimilarity measures are tested in the context of real solution sets of Java programs. The quantitative evidence suggests that the proposed feedback strategies and automatic example assignment are viable in principle, further user studies in large-scale learning environments being the subject of future research.","David Azcona,Alan F.

Despite the buzz surrounding these models, the literature is still lacking a systematic comparison of the predictive models with classic, count-vector-based distributional semantic approaches. In this paper, we perform such an extensive evaluation, on a wide range of lexical semantics tasks and across many parameter settings. The results, to our own surprise, show that the buzz is fully justified, as the context-predicting models obtain a thorough and resounding victory against their count-based counterparts.","David Azcona,I-Han Hsiao,Alan F.

,,,A Convolutional Attention Network for Extreme Summarization of Source Code,"Attention mechanisms in neural networks have proved useful for problems in which the input and output do not have fixed dimension. Often there exist features that are locally translation invariant and would be valuable for directing the model's attention, but previous attentional architectures are not constructed to learn such features specifically. We introduce an attentional neural network that employs convolution on the input tokens to detect local time-invariant and long-range topical attention features in a context-dependent way. We apply this architecture to the problem of extreme summarization of source code snippets into short, descriptive function name-like summaries. Using those features, the model sequentially generates a summary by marginalizing over two attention mechanisms: one that predicts the next summary token based on the attention weights of the input tokens and another that is able to copy a code token as-is directly into the summary. We demonstrate our convolutional attention neural network's performance on 10 popular Java projects showing that it achieves better performance compared to previous attentional mechanisms.","David Azcona,I-Han Hsiao,Alan F.

However, different from a natural language sentence, a program contains rich, explicit, and complicated structural information. Hence, traditional NLP models may be inappropriate for programs. In this paper, we propose a novel tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) for programming language processing, in which a convolution kernel is designed over programs' abstract syntax trees to capture structural information. TBCNN is a generic architecture for programming language processing; our experiments show its effectiveness in two different program analysis tasks: classifying programs according to functionality, and detecting code snippets of certain patterns. TBCNN outperforms baseline methods, including several neural models for NLP.","David Azcona,I-Han Hsiao,Alan F. Smeaton",arXiv: Learning,2014

,,,Tensor Factorization for Student Modeling and Performance Prediction in Unstructured Domain.,"© 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society. All rights reserved. We propose a novel tensor factorization approach, Feedback-Driven Tensor Factorization (FDTF), for modeling student learning process and predicting student performance. This approach decomposes a tensor that is built upon students’ attempt sequence, while considering the quizzes students select to work with as its feedback. FDTF does not require any prior domain knowledge, such as learning resource skills, concept maps, or Q-matrices. The proposed approach differs significantly from other tensor factorization approaches, as it explicitly models the learning progress of students while interacting with the learning resources. We compare our approach to other state-of-the-art approaches in the task of Predicting Student Performance (PSP). Our experiments show that FDTF performs significantly better compared to baseline methods, including Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and a state-of-the-art tensor factorization approach.","David Azcona,Owen Corrigan,Philip Scanlon,Alan F.

From the moment students apply to a university and thereafter gain acceptance and attend the campus they create a unique digital footprint of themselves within the university IT systems. Students’ digital footprints are a source of data that is of interest to groups including teachers, analysts, administrators and policy makers in the education, sociology, and pedagogy domains. Learning analytics can offer tools to mine such data producing actionable knowledge for purposes of improving student retention, curriculum enhancement, student progress and feedback, and administrative evolution. In this paper, we summarise three ongoing Learning Analytics projects from an Irish university, demonstrating the potential that exists to enhance Higher Education pedagogical approaches. First year students often struggle with making the transition into University as they adapt to life and study at a Higher Education Institution. The research projects in the area of Learning Analytics at our institution focus on: improving test performance using analytics from a general-purpose VLE like Moodle, identifying studying groups and the performance peer effect using on-campus geolocation data, and detecting lower-performing or at-risk students on programming modules.","David Hestenes,Malcolm Wells,Gregg Swackhamer",,2017

Using historical data from previous student cohorts we built a predictive model using logged interactions between students and online resources, as well as students’ progress in programming laboratory work. Predictions were calculated each week during a 12-week semester. Course lecturers received student lists ranked by their probability of failing the next computer-based laboratory exam. At-risk students were targeted and offered assistance during laboratory sessions by the lecturer and laboratory tutors. When we group students into two cohorts depending on whether they failed or passed their first laboratory exam, the average margin of improvement on the second laboratory exam between the higher and lower-performing students was four times higher when our predictions were run and subsequent laboratory support targeted at these students, compared to students from the year our model was trained on.","David N.

The observations are stored in enriched event streams that encode a holistic picture of the in-IDE development process. Enriched event streams capture all commands invoked in the IDE with additional context information, such as the test being run or the accompanying fine-grained code edits. We used F eed B a G to collect enriched event streams from 81 developers.

,,,Code2vec: Learning Distributed Representations of Code,"We present a neural model for representing snippets of code as continuous distributed vectors (""code embeddings""). The main idea is to represent a code snippet as a single fixed-length $\textit{code vector}$, which can be used to predict semantic properties of the snippet. This is performed by decomposing code to a collection of paths in its abstract syntax tree, and learning the atomic representation of each path $\textit{simultaneously}$ with learning how to aggregate a set of them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by using it to predict a method's name from the vector representation of its body. We evaluate our approach by training a model on a dataset of 14M methods. We show that code vectors trained on this dataset can predict method names from files that were completely unobserved during training. Furthermore, we show that our model learns useful method name vectors that capture semantic similarities, combinations, and analogies. Comparing previous techniques over the same data set, our approach obtains a relative improvement of over 75%, being the first to successfully predict method names based on a large, cross-project, corpus.

PredictCS embeds multiple predictive models by leveraging multi-modal learning analytics of student data, including student characteristics, prior academic history, logged interactions between students and online resources, and students' progress in programming laboratory work, and their progression from introductory to advanced CS courses. Predictions are generated every week during the semester's classes.

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of ""Canada"" and ""Air"" cannot be easily combined to obtain ""Air Canada"". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.","Dongzhi Zhang,Kyungmi Lee,Ickjai Lee",arXiv: Computation and Language,2013
,,,A General Path-Based Representation for Predicting Program Properties.,"Predicting program properties such as names or expression types has a wide range of applications. It can ease the task of programming and increase programmer productivity. A major challenge when learning from programs is $\textit{how to represent programs in a way that facilitates effective learning}$. 
We present a $\textit{general path-based representation}$ for learning from programs. Our representation is purely syntactic and extracted automatically. The main idea is to represent a program using paths in its abstract syntax tree (AST). This allows a learning model to leverage the structured nature of code rather than treating it as a flat sequence of tokens. 
We show that this representation is general and can: (i) cover different prediction tasks, (ii) drive different learning algorithms (for both generative and discriminative models), and (iii) work across different programming languages. 
We evaluate our approach on the tasks of predicting variable names, method names, and full types. We use our representation to drive both CRF-based and word2vec-based learning, for programs of four languages: JavaScript, Java, Python and C\#. Our evaluation shows that our approach obtains better results than task-specific handcrafted representations across different tasks and programming languages.","Donna Teague,Raymond Lister",arXiv: Programming Languages,2018

This work combines these themes by including a common set of short questions in the final examinations of introductory programming courses at six institutions in Australia and New Zealand, and analysing the student performance across all six institutions.

The findings indicated that most students were able to articulate an interpretation of the feedback presented through the dashboard to identify gaps between their expected and actual performance to inform changes to their study strategies. However, there was also evidence of uncertain interpretation both in terms of the format of the visualization of the feedback and their inability to understand the connection between the feedback and their current strategies.

This hypothesis is consistent with a model of physics reasoning and learning from the Knowledge in Pieces theoretical framework and in this research I build upon education research outside of computer science.

The aim of this study was to investigate cooperative programming learning behavior of students and its relationship with learning performance. Students' opinions and perceptions toward learning activity and the WPASC were also investigated. The results of this study revealed that most of students perceived that learning activity and the WPASC were useful for cooperative programming learning. Students' learning behavior during cooperative programming learning activity was classified into six different categories and we found that learning behavior has relationship with learning performance. Students from completely independent, self-improving using assistance, confident after enlightenment and imitating categories performed well due to their effective and motivated learning behavior. However, students from performing poorly without assistance and plagiarizing categories performed the worse; the former could not get assistance at all and the later had no learning motivation. The results also showed that students' learning behavior may have increasing, decreasing and no transition during problems solving. Therefore, performing poorly without assistance and plagiarizing learning behavior and decreasing transition or no transition in learning behavior should be identified right after completing a programming problem. Then the instructor should intervene into learning behavior in order to change it into more effective for learning. Besides, more incentives need to be given for increasing students' learning motivation and posting solutions and feedback by students at the early stage of a problem solving period.","Elena García Barriocanal,Miguel-Ángel Sicilia Urbán,Ignacio Aedo Cuevas,Paloma Díaz Pérez",Computers in Education,2012

In this article, we describe a study of undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory web development course taken by both computing majors and general education students. Using data collected during the initial weeks of the course, we investigate the nature of the syntax errors they make when learning HTML and CSS, and how they resolve them. This is accomplished through the deployment of openHTML, a lightweight web-based code editor that logs user activity. Our analysis reveals that nearly all students made syntax errors that remained unresolved in their assessments, and that these errors continued weeks into the course. Approximately 20p of these errors related to the relatively complex system of rules that dictates when it is valid for HTML elements to be nested in one another. On the other hand, 35p of errors related to the relatively simple tag syntax determining how HTML elements are nested. We also find that validation played a key role in resolving errors: While the majority of unresolved errors were present in untested code, nearly all of the errors that were detected through validation were eventually corrected. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and their implications for computing education.","Elizabeth R.

But efforts to engage K-12 students in CT are hampered by a lack of definition and assessment tools. In this paper, we describe the first results of a newly created performance assessment tool for measuring CT in middle school. We briefly describe the context for the performance assessment (game-programming courses), the aspects of CT that are measured, the results, and the factors that are associated with performance. We see the development of assessment tools as a critical step in efforts to bring CT to K-12, and to strengthen the use of game programming in middle school. We discuss problems and implications of our results.","Felienne Hermans,Kathryn T. Stolee,David Hoepelman",,2012
10.1109/stair.2011.5995769,,,Using Latent Semantic Analysis for automated grading programming assignments,"Traditionally, computer programming assignments are graded manually by educators. As this task is tedious, time-consuming and prone to bias, the need for automated grading tool is necessary to reduce the educators' burden and avoid inconsistency and favoritism. Recent researches have claimed that Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) has the ability to represent human cognitive knowledge to assess essays, retrieving information, classification of documents and indexing. In this paper, we adapt LSA technique to grade computer programming assignments and observe how far it can be applied as an alternative approach to traditional grading methods by human. The grades of the assignments are generated from the cosine similarity that shows how close students' assignments to the model answers in the latent semantic vector space. The results show that LSA is not able to detect orders of computer programming and symbols; however, LSA is able to grade assignments faster and consistently, which avoid bias and reduces the time spent by human.","Ference Marton,Roger Säljö",,2011
10.1016/j.compedu.2008.01.006,,,Assessing creative problem-solving with automated text grading,"The work aims to improve the assessment of creative problem-solving in science education by employing language technologies and computational-statistical machine learning methods to grade students' natural language responses automatically. To evaluate constructs like creative problem-solving with validity, open-ended questions that elicit students' constructed responses are beneficial. But the high cost required in manually grading constructed responses could become an obstacle in applying open-ended questions. In this study, automated grading schemes have been developed and evaluated in the context of secondary Earth science education. Empirical evaluations revealed that the automated grading schemes may reliably identify domain concepts embedded in students' natural language responses with satisfactory inter-coder agreement against human coding in two sub-tasks of the test (Cohen's Kappa=.65-.72). And when a single holistic score was computed for each student, machine-generated scores achieved high inter-rater reliability against human grading (Pearson's r=.92). The reliable performance in automatic concept identification and numeric grading demonstrates the potential of using automated grading to support the use of open-ended questions in science assessments and enable new technologies for science learning.","Filipe D.

In Finland and Sweden, informatics is not included in the core curriculum, whereas, for example, in Lithuania, all students are exposed to some informatics concepts starting in the fifth grade. Bebras is an annually arranged international informatics contest for K-12 level, resulting in a large collection of data about contestants and their results. In this paper, we analyse contest data from the Finnish, Swedish and Lithuanian 2013 con- tests, focusing on students' performance on tasks related to algorithmic thinking. Our findings suggest that despite coming from different educational systems, students perform rather similarly on the tasks. The same tasks are difficult and the thinking behind picking an incorrect answer seems rather similar throughout the countries. The analysis also points out that there is a lack of easy questions -- this needs to be fixed in order to not risk scaring students away.","Gabriella Tisza,Panos Markopoulos",,2014

During our research on teaching and learning computer science concepts with Scratch, we discovered that Scratch engenders certain habits of programming: (a) a totally bottom-up development process that starts with the individual Scratch blocks, and (b) a tendency to extremely fine-grained programming. Both these behaviors are at odds with accepted practice in computer science that encourages one: (a) to start by designing an algorithm to solve a problem, and (b) to use programming constructs to cleanly structure programs. Our results raise the question of whether exploratory learning with a visual programming environment might actually be detrimental to more advanced study.","Geoffrey L. Herman,Craig Zilles,Michael C.

In this article, we look at the transition from studying CS with the visual Scratch environment in middle school to studying CS with a professional textual programming language (C# or Java) in secondary school. We found that the programming knowledge and experience of students who had learned Scratch greatly facilitated learning the more advanced material in secondary school: less time was needed to learn new topics, there were fewer learning difficulties, and they achieved higher cognitive levels of understanding of most concepts (although at the end of the teaching process, there were no significant differences in achievements compared to students who had not studied Scratch). Furthermore, there was increased enrollment in CS classes, and students were observed to display higher levels of motivation and self-efficacy.

We analyzed teachers' learning of what CS entails and the implementation of inquirybased programming lessons in their schools. Based on pre and post teachers surveys and classroom observations, we found that most teachers learned about the CS object of study and about fundamental programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, variables, etc. Teachers were more likely to replicate the same activities they experienced during PD workshops in their classrooms than to produce their own. Teachers who had a previous background on CS provided in-depth explanations of CS concepts to their students while other teachers superficially introduced the content knowledge. We describe PD activities and characteristics that could explain teachers' learning and incorporation of programming lessons. Findings imply that a PD program that integrates pedagogical content knowledge and teachers classroom practice can effectively improve inquiry-based CS teaching, but may be insufficient preparation for teachers with no previous background on CS.","Griet Lust,Jan Elen,Geraldine Clarebout",,2016

This study attempts to investigate the effect of teaching code.org site on reflective thinking skills towards problem solving. More specifically, this study attempts to investigate whether there is a gender difference in terms of students' reflective thinking skills towards problem solving. This triangulation study was conducted with 32 primary school students. The quantitative part of the study was conducted in pre-test/post-test comparison design of quasi-experimental design. The scores of reflective problem solving skills were gathered through the reflective thinking skill scale towards problem solving and the students' performances in the code-org site were examined. In the qualitative part of the research, after the five-week experimental process, focus group interviews were conducted with ten students and a reflection paper from the IT teacher was analysed. According to the t-test results, teaching programming to primary school students in the code.org site did not cause any differences in reflective thinking skills towards problem solving. However, there is a slight increment in the means of female students' reflective thinking skills towards problem solving over the males' reflective thinking skills towards problem solving. On the other hand, qualitative data provided more information about the students' experiences.

The students' responses to each question were scrutinized by using the Delphi concept inventory, heuristic-analytic theory, and neo-Piagetian theory of cognitive development for qualitative data analysis. Moreover, the motivation for this exploratory study was to also address the misconceptions that students held in programming and help educators to redefine the teaching methods to correct those alternative conceptions. Student misconceptions were spotted in list referencing and inbuilt functions in Python. In a further quantitative analysis, the study found that students who had misconceptions made knowledge errors and failed to complete the coding tasks.

The problem appears because the students come with serious deficiencies from their previous education level (secondary schools). Among these deficiencies, we identify their lack of abstraction capabilities and mathematical skills, which are usually considered as prerrequisites to take a programming course. This article introduces the GOBSTONES method for teaching an introductory programming course. The method was developed at the Universidad Nacional de Quilmes in Argentina, taking into account the described background of the students, and has shown a positive impact by improving the passing rate of those students. GOBSTONES method's main goal was to foster abstraction and abstract thinking to students that have not developed good abstraction skills. A programming language, also called GOB-STONES, was developed to implement the ideas presented herein. The method focuses on the representation of information, both at the level of code in the form of procedures to express abstraction, and at the level of the universe of discourse, which is a concrete one, but allowing the representation of information in a simple way. Moreover, the tools implementing GOBSTONES have a feature that enables the student to see a visualization of the represented elements.","Harshal Chaudhari,Martin Crane",,2017

Indeed, such predictions can help educators not only to identify at-risk students, but also to better tailor their instructional methods. In computing education, at least two different measures, the Error Quotient and Watwin Score, have achieved modest success at predicting student course performance based solely on students' compilation attempts. We hypothesize that one can achieve even greater predictive power by considering students' programming activities more holistically. To that end, we derive the Normalized Programming State Model (NPSM), which characterizes students' programming activity in terms of the dynamically-changing syntactic and semantic correctness of their programs. In an empirical study, the NPSM accounted for 41% of the variance in students' programming assignment grades, and 36% of the variance in students' final course grades. We identify the components of the NPSM that contribute to its explanatory power, and derive a formula capable of predicting students' course programming performance with between 36 and 67 percent accuracy, depending on the quantity of programming process data.","Huan Wei,Haotian Li,Meng Xia,Yong Wang,Huamin Qu",,2015

This is possibly because research to date is based upon using static tests, which fail to reflect changes in a student's learning progress over time. In this paper, the effectiveness of 38 traditional predictors of programming performance are compared to 12 new data-driven predictors, that are based upon analyzing directly logged data, describing the programming behavior of students. Whilst few strong correlations were found between the traditional predictors and performance, an abundance of strong significant correlations based upon programming behavior were found. A model based upon two of these metrics (Watwin score and percentage of lab time spent resolving errors) could explain 56.3% of the variance in coursework results. The implication of this study is that a student's programming behavior is one of the strongest indicators of their performance, and future work should continue to explore such predictors in different teaching contexts.","I-Han Hsiao,Sesha Kumar Pandhalkudi Govindarajan,Yi-Ling Lin",,2014

We chose two badging platforms - ClassDojo and ClassBadges - to be evaluated based on 7 different criteria. The main objectives were to generate involvement among individual and particular situations, increasing the interest, engagement and efficiency while performing a specific task. We observed the behavior of 61 students from an elementary public school in Brazil as part of our field research. Data were collected using observation, semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. Quantitative data were statistically analyzed using a multivariate technique known as cluster analysis. The results allowed us to classify students in 4 distinct groups and showed that students who received more rewards from the teacher got significantly better average performances. Cluster analysis was used to classify student engagement.Students with low engagement can be stimulated to do this activities through gamification techniques.Engagement indicators were identified and may be useful for future research in the area.Teacher participations is absolutely necessary to create experiences that include game mechanics for students.The objectives to be achieved in the classroom should be adherent with the mechanics of games.","Ilya Musabirov,Alina Bakhitova",Computers in Human Behavior,2016
10.1145/2899415.2899463,,,A New Metric to Quantify Repeated Compiler Errors for Novice Programmers,"Encountering the same compiler error repeatedly, particularly several times consecutively, has been cited as a strong indicator that a student is struggling with important programming concepts. Despite this, there are relatively few studies which investigate repeated errors in isolation or in much depth. There are also few data-driven metrics for measuring programming performance, and fewer for measuring repeated errors. This paper makes two contributions. First we introduce a new metric to quantify repeated errors, the repeated error density (RED). We compare this to Jadud's Error Quotient (EQ), the most studied metric, and show that RED has advantages over EQ including being less context dependent, and being useful for short sessions. This allows us to answer two questions posited by Jadud in 2006 that have until now been unanswered. Second, we compare the EQ and RED scores using data from an empirical control/intervention group study involving an editor which enhances compiler error messages. This intervention group has been previously shown to have a reduced overall number of student errors, number of errors per student, and number of repeated student errors per compiler error message. In this research we find a reduction in EQ, providing further evidence that error message enhancement has positive effects. In addition we find a significant reduction in RED providing evidence that this metric is valid.","Inseong Jeon,전인성,Song Ki Sang,Song Kisang,Ki-Sang Song",,2016

In this article, we discuss the design and implementation of a collaborative learning tool called ViLLE. The design is based on experiences gathered from a previously developed and thoroughly researched visualization tool. Based on our earlier results and current educational theories, we developed four design principles upon which ViLLE is constructed. ViLLE includes various different exercise types which were designed to assist in the learning of computer science, mathematics and other subjects. It also supports different learning and teaching methods, such as pair programming and peer review. To justify the development of a new environment, we present four diverse case studies where ViLLE was utilized successfully: programming education, high school matriculation exam, elementary school mathematics and student counseling at university level. The results obtained from the studies seem to confirm that ViLLE can be used effectively to enhance student motivation and to improve student performance in various heterogeneous educational setups.","Iulian Neamtiu,Jeffrey S.

10.1145/3372782.3406264,,,Adaptive Immediate Feedback Can Improve Novice Programming Engagement and Intention to Persist in Computer Science,"Prior work suggests that novice programmers are greatly impacted by the feedback provided by their programming environments. While some research has examined the impact of feedback on student learning in programming, there is no work (to our knowledge) that examines the impact of adaptive immediate feedback within programming environments on students' desire to persist in computer science (CS). In this paper, we integrate an adaptive immediate feedback (AIF) system into a block-based programming environment. Our AIF system is novel because it provides personalized positive and corrective feedback to students in real time as they work. In a controlled pilot study with novice high-school programmers, we show that our AIF system significantly increased students' intentions to persist in CS, and that students using AIF had greater engagement (as measured by their lower idle time) compared to students in the control condition. Further, we found evidence that the AIF system may improve student learning, as measured by student performance in a subsequent task without AIF. In interviews, students found the system fun and helpful, and reported feeling more focused and engaged. We hope this paper spurs more research on adaptive immediate feedback and the impact of programming environments on students' intentions to persist in CS.",J. R. Quinlan,,2020

This working group investigated the programming competency students have as they complete their first one or two courses in computer science. In order to explore options for assessing students, the working group developed a trial assessment of whether students can program. The underlying goal of this work was to initiate dialog in the Computer Science community on how to develop these types of assessments. Several universities participated in our trial assessment and the disappointing results suggest that many students do not know how to program at the conclusion of their introductory courses. For a combined sample of 216 students from four universities, the average score was 22.89 out of 110 points on the general evaluation criteria developed for this study. From this trial assessment we developed a framework of expectations for first-year courses and suggestions for further work to develop more comprehensive assessments.","Jacqueline Wong,Martine Baars,Dan Davis,Tim van der Zee,Geert-Jan Houben,Fred Paas",SIGCSE bulletin,
,,,Emergent geometric organization and informative dimensions in coevolutionary algorithms,"Coevolutionary algorithms vary entities which can play two or more distinct, interacting roles, with the hope of producing raw material from which a highly-capable composition can be constructed. Ranging in complexity from autodidactic checkers-learning systems to the evolution of competing agents in 3-d simulated physics, applications of these algorithms have proved both motivating and perplexing. Successful applications inspire further application, supporting the belief that a correctly implemented form of evolution by natural selection can produce highly-capable entities with minimal human input or intervention. However, the successes to date have generated limited insight into how to transfer success to other domains. On the other hand, failed applications leave behind a frustratingly opaque trace of misbehavior. In either case, the question of what worked or what went wrong is often left open. 
One impediment to understanding the dynamics of coevolutionary algorithms is that the interactive domains explored by these algorithms typically lack an explicit objective function. Such a function is a clear guide for judging the progress or regress of an algorithm. However, in the absence of an explicit yardstick to judge the value of coevolving entities, how should they be measured? 
To begin addressing this question, we start with the observation that in any interaction, an entity is not only performing a task, it is also informing about the capabilities of its interactants. In other words, an interaction can provide a measurement. Entities themselves can therefore be treated as measuring rods, here dubbed informative dimensions, against which other entities are incented to improve. It is argued that when entities are only incented to perform well, and adaptation of the function of measurement is neglected, algorithms tend not to keep informative dimensions and thus fail to produce high-performing entities. 
It is demonstrated empirically that algorithms which are sensitized to these yardsticks through an informativeness mechanism have better dynamic behavior; in particular, known pathologies such as overspecialization, cycling, or relative overgeneralization are mitigated. We argue that in these cases an emergent geometric organization of the population implicitly maintains informative dimensions, providing a direction to the evolving population and so permitting continued improvement.","Jacques-Antoine Gauthier,Eric Widmer,Eric Widmer,Philipp Bucher,Cedric Notredame",,2007

While students are more than capable of memorizing the details of these competing approaches, they often struggle to recommend a specific approach and analyze its implications. In particular, we find that students exhibit difficultly in interpreting text-based scenario descriptions in a way that allows them to correctly choose between potential solutions when presented with a high-level, conceptual scenario.   In this paper, we describe the development of a pre- and post-course concept inventory, which we utilize to explore students' misconceptions of operating systems and their associated trade-offs. We compare the results of our assessment with in-class peer instruction questions and exam questions to characterize the areas in which students most commonly struggle with operating systems material.","Jan Skalka,Martin Drlík",,2014

10.1145/2591708.2591722,,,Leveraging open source principles for flexible concept inventory development,"Concept Inventory (CI) assessments, which target high-level learning goals, have proven highly valuable for higher education research. These assessments have helped to evaluate pedagogical practices among individual instructors, both within and across institutions, and have hence elevated the level of discourse on education within the community. The success of CIs in physics has inspired similar developments in computer science, with a few CIs now developed for computer science courses. However, the development of a CI typically follows a burdensome process, requiring a significant investment to produce a single CI that may be difficult to deploy due to institutional curricular differences. Furthermore, as our field continues to be shaped by technological advances, a path to faster, more modular CI development is critical.   This paper proposes an alternative CI development model and continues the discussion within the community about the need for, and path to, concept inventories throughout the computer science curriculum. Specifically, we explore the implications of an open collaboration system for CI development that would mimic the principles common to open source software communities, which have regularly demonstrated their ability to produce high-quality results.","Jan Vahrenhold,Wolfgang Paul",,2014

We need to understand these misconceptions more clearly in order to help students form correct conceptions. This paper describes one stage in the development of a concept inventory for Computing Fundamentals: investigation of student misconceptions in a series of core CS1 topics previously identified as both important and difficult. Formal interviews with students revealed four distinct themes, each containing many interesting misconceptions. Three of those misconceptions are detailed in this paper: two misconceptions about memory models, and data assignment when primitives are declared. Individual misconceptions are related, but vary widely, thus providing excellent material to use in the development of the CI. In addition, CS1 instructors are provided immediate usable material for helping their students understand some difficult introductory concepts.","Jean-Philippe Bouchaud,Marc Potters",,2010
10.1145/2445196.2445254,,,Investigating factors of student learning in introductory courses,"Instructors of the introductory computer science courses, commonly called ""CS1"" and ""CS2"", face a large number of choices when designing their classes. Instructors have available to them a multitude of ways to explain each topic as well as course-wide choices such as objects-first or objects-late or using a functional or procedural language. Understanding how these options can affect student learning would help simplify these decisions. Unfortunately, just comparing how well students perform may not be accurate as it ignores the many confounding factors that could also have made a difference. To get beyond that problem, this study investigates underlying factors that affect student learning. Using a survey of instructors, we find that students' abilities are nearly always correlated with the importance that the instructor placed on a particular topic. Our results also highlight several ""hard"" topics for which student mastery and topic importance were not correlated in CS1 and only weakly correlated in CS2. While one might expect the time spent covering a topic in class to also be correlated with student mastery, we find little evidence of this. In fact, for some basic programming concepts, we document negative correlations between instructional time and learning. We discuss how instructors can use these results when organizing their courses and how the computer science education community can use this finding of ""hard"" topics to focus their efforts.",Jeannette M.

Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.","Jee Yeon Lee,Miah Kam,Nam Gi Han,Hanna Song",User Modeling and User-adapted Interaction,1995

Student misconceptions most commonly encountered included notions that electrons flow through the salt bridge and electrolyte solutions to complete the circuit, plus and minus signs assigned to the electrodes represent net electronic charges, and water is unreactive in the electrolysis of aqueous solutions. New misconceptions identified included notions that half-cell potentials are absolute and can be used to predict the spontaneity of individual half-cells, and electrochemical cell potentials are independent of ion concentrations. Most students demonstrating misconceptions were still able to calculate cell potentials correctly, which is consistent with research suggesting that students capable of solving quantitative examination problems often lack an understanding of the underlying concepts. Probable origins of these student misconceptions were attributed to students being unaware of the relative nature of electrochemical potentials and chemistry textbooks making misleading and incorrect statements.

This paper takes a closer look at the processes involved in the acquisition of flexible problem-solving skills within a cognitive load framework. It concludes that (1) cognitive load theory can benefit from putting more emphasis on generalized knowledge structures; (2) there are tradeoffs between generality and power with respect to specific versus generalized knowledge structures; (3) generalized knowledge structures of “medium” generality are essential for flexible expertise; and (4) cognitive load theory could provide a valuable framework for considering essential attributes of flexible expertise.","Jelena Jovanovic,Shane Dawson,Maarten de Laat,Srećko Joksimović,George Siemens",Educational Psychology Review,2010

In light of these studies, a natural question is: to what extent do these results hold for subsequent, upper-division computer science courses? In this paper we describe our work in creating high-level concept questions for an upper-division computer architecture course. The questions were designed and agreed upon by subject-matter and teaching experts to measure desired minimum proficiency of students post-course. These questions were administered to four separate computer architecture courses at two different institutions: a large public university and a small liberal arts college. Our results show that students in these courses were indeed not learning as much as the instructors expected, performing poorly overall: the per-question average was only 56%, with many questions showing no statistically significant improvement from pre-course to post-course. While these results follow the trend from CS1 courses, they are still somewhat surprising given that the courses studied were taught using research-based pedagogy that is known to be effective across the CS curriculum.

The application of IRT models has now extended to other social sciences, including health. Originally, there was substantial controversy between those who saw Rasch models as simply special cases of IRT models and those who saw them as essentially different. Because these different perspectives continue to manifest themselves in various ways, it seems relevant to understand the source of the original controversy. This paper attempts to do so by invoking Kuhn's studies in the history and philosophy of science at 3 levels. First, it suggests that the 2 perspectives reflect Kuhn's concept of legitimate, incompatible paradigms in which controversy is a typical manifestation. Second, because Kuhn recognizes individual histories in the development of paradigms, Rasch's own shift in perspective is summarized. Third, because proponents of the Rasch models emphasize the models' compatibility with fundamental measurement found in physical science, an analogy is made between how Kuhn explains the role of measurement in the physical sciences and how proponents of Rasch models explain the role of these models in the social sciences. In particular, these roles cannot be gleaned from textbooks in science and statistics, respectively.",Jens Krinke,Medical Care,2004

Such tutors have the potential to provide tailored feedback based on specific student needs and misunderstandings. Bayesian knowledge tracing (BKT) is used to model student knowledge when knowledge is assumed to be changing throughout a single assessment period; in contrast, traditional Item Response Theory (IRT) models assume student knowledge to be constant within an assessment period. The basic BKT model assumes that the chance a student transitions from ""not knowing"" to ""knowing"" after each item is the same, and problems are considered learning opportunities. It could be the case, however, that learning is actually context sensitive, where students' learning might be improved when the items and their associated tutoring content are delivered to the student in a particular order. In this paper, we use BKT models to find such context sensitive transition probabilities from real data delivered by an online tutoring system, ASSISTments. After empirically deriving orderings that lead to better learning, we qualitatively analyze the items and their tutoring content to uncover any mechanisms that might explain why such orderings are modeled to have higher learning potential.","Jesús Moreno-León,Jesus Moreno,Gregorio Robles",,2015

10.1007/s10734-004-6779-5,,,Threshold concepts and troublesome knowledge (2): Epistemological considerations and a conceptual framework for teaching and learning,"The present study builds on earlier work by Meyer and Land (2003) which introduced the generative notion of threshold concepts within (and across) disciplines, in the sense of transforming the internal view of subject matter or part thereof. In this earlier work such concepts were further linked to forms of knowledge that are ‘troublesome’, after the work of Perkins (1999). It was argued that these twinned sets of ideas may define critical moments of irreversible conceptual transformation in the educational experiences of learners, and their teachers. The present study aims (a) to examine the extent to which such phenomena can be located within personal understandings of discipline-specific epistemological discourses, (b) to develop more extensively notions of liminality within learning that were raised in the first paper, and (c) to propose a conceptual framework within which teachers may advance their own reflective practice.","John Hattie,Gregory M.

Through clustering of students (N=81) in a graduate distance education engineering course, we identified six different profiles: 1) task-focused users, 2) content-focused no-users, 3) no-users, 4) highly intensive users, 5) content-focused intensive users, and 6) socially-focused intensive users. Identified profiles significantly differ in terms of their use of learning platform and their levels of cognitive presence, with large effect sizes of 0.54 and 0.19 multivariate η2, respectively. Given that several profiles are associated with higher levels of cognitive presence, our results suggest multiple ways for students to be successful within communities of inquiry. Our results also emphasize a need for a different instructional support and pedagogical interventions for different technology-use profiles.","Jordan Pollack,Anthony Bucci",Internet and Higher Education,2015

A meta-analysis on self-regulation training programmes,"Abstract   Recently, research has increasingly focused on fostering self-regulated learning amongst young children. To consider this trend, this article presents the results of a differentiated meta-analysis of 48 treatment comparisons resulting from 30 articles on enhancing self-regulated learning amongst primary school students. Based on recent models of self-regulated learning, which consider motivational, as well as cognitive, and metacognitive aspects [Boekaerts, M. (1999). Self-regulated learning: Where we are today.  International Journal of Educational research, 31(6) , 445–457], the effects of self-regulated learning on academic achievement, on cognitive and metacognitive strategy application, as well as on motivation were analyzed. As the results show, self-regulated learning training programmes proved to be effective, even at primary school level. Subsequent analysis tested for the effects of several moderator variables, which consisted of study features and training characteristics. Regarding factors that concern the content of the treatment, the impact of the theoretical background that underlies the intervention was tested, as well as the type of cognitive, metacognitive, or motivational strategy which were instructed, and if group work was used as instruction method. Training context related factors, which were included in the analyses consisted of students’ grade level, the length of the training, if teachers or researchers directed the intervention, as well as the school subject in which context the training took place. Following the results of these analyses, a list with the most effective training characteristics was provided.","José Manuel Sáez López,José-Manuel Sáez-López,Marcos Román-González,Esteban Vázquez Cano,Esteban Vázquez-Cano",Educational Research Review,2008
10.1111/j.1467-9531.2010.01227.x,,,MULTICHANNEL SEQUENCE ANALYSIS APPLIED TO SOCIAL SCIENCE DATA,"Applications of optimal matching analysis in the social sciences are typically based on sequences of specific social statuses that model the residential, familial, or occupational trajectories of individuals. Despite the broadly recognized interdependence of these statuses, few attempts have been made to systematize the ways in which optimal matching analysis should be applied multidimensionally, i.e., in an approach that takes into account multiple trajectories simultaneously. Based on methods pioneered in the field of bioinformatics, this article proposes the method of multichannel sequence analysis (MCSA), which simultaneously extends the usual optimal matching analysis (OMA) to multiple life spheres. Using data from the Swiss household panel (SHP), we examine the types of trajectories obtained using MCSA. We find that MCSA offers an alternative to the sole use of ex-post sum of distance matrices by locally aligning distinct life trajectories simultaneously. Moreover, MCSA reduces the complexity of the results without making them less informative, it is more robust to noise in the data, and it provides more reliable alignments than two independent OMAs.","Josh Gardner,Christopher Brooks",Sociological Methodology,2010

This paper describes an attempt to identify different levels of processing of information among groups of Swedish university students who were asked to read substantial passages of prose. Students were asked questions about the meaning of the passages and also about how they set about reading the passages. This approach allows processes and strategies of learning to be examined, as well as the outcomes in terms of what is understood and remembered. The starting point of this research was that learning has to be described in terms of its content. From this point differences in what is learned, rather than differences in how much is learned, are described. It was found that in each study a number of categories (levels of outcome) containing basically different conceptions of the content of the learning task could be identified. The corresponding differences in level of processing are described in terms of whether the learner is engaged in surface-level or deep-level processing.","Judy Sheard,Simon,Julian Dermoudy,Daryl D'Souza,Minjie Hu,Dale Parsons",British Journal of Educational Psychology,1976

The meta-analysis included 58 studies in primary and secondary education on interventions aimed at improving cognitive, metacognitive, and management strategy skills, as well as motivational aspects and metacognitive knowledge. A total of 95 interventions and 180 effect sizes demonstrated substantial effects in the domains of writing (Hedges' g=1.25), science (.73), mathematics (.66) and comprehensive reading (.36). These domains differed in terms of which strategies were the most effective in improving academic performance. However, metacognitive knowledge instruction appeared to be valuable in all of them. Furthermore, it was found that the effects were higher when self-developed tests were used than in the case of intervention-independent tests. Finally, no differential effects were observed for students with different ability levels. To conclude, the authors have listed some implications of their analysis for the educational practice and made some suggestions for further research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

There is evidence of disciplinary variation in students' approaches to learning. Furthermore, previous research has shown that students' approaches are related to their perceptions of the learning environment.

Aim
The overall objective of the study was to analyse combinations of approaches to learning among undergraduates in different disciplines. More precisely, the aim was to cluster students on the basis of their scores on different items measuring approaches to learning, and to explore the relationship between the clusters and both the disciplines of the students and their perceptions of the teaching–learning environment.

Sample
A total of 2,509 students participated in the study.

Methods
The students were asked to complete an on-line questionnaire, which was a revised version of the Experience of Teaching and Learning Questionnaire. It included items covering approaches to learning and perceptions of the teaching–learning environment.

Results
The students were classified in four clusters. There were significant differences in how the respondents from the 10 faculties were represented in these clusters. There were also differences in their perceptions of the teaching–learning environment in the different faculties.

Conclusions
It appears that there is disciplinary variation in approaches to learning. Furthermore, the results indicate that both approaches to learning and the discipline have an effect on students' experiences of the teaching–learning environment.",Juho Hamari,British Journal of Educational Psychology,2010

What is striking is that, although students perform many tasks in the classroom, they are rarely asked systematically to describe in detail how they proceed in performing them. The author proposes a self-observation and self-report procedure that will assist teachers in discovering their students' learning strategies and, as a by-product, may generate knowledge about the second language learning process. Transcriptions of segments of interviews with four students illustrate the questioning procedure and principles involved in eliciting students' strategies. Analyses of interview segments underscore a lack of congruence between what students are thought to be doing and what they actually are doing.","Juho Leinonen,Krista Longi,Arto Klami,Arto Vihavainen",Foreign Language Annals,1976
10.1145/2591708.2591749,,,Failure rates in introductory programming revisited,"Whilst working on an upcoming meta-analysis that synthesized fifty years of research on predictors of programming performance, we made an interesting discovery. Despite several studies citing a motivation for research as the high failure rates of introductory programming courses, to date, the majority of available evidence on this phenomenon is at best anecdotal in nature, and only a single study by Bennedsen and Caspersen has attempted to determine a worldwide pass rate of introductory programming courses.   In this paper, we answer the call for further substantial evidence on the CS1 failure rate phenomenon, by performing a systematic review of introductory programming literature, and a statistical analysis on pass rate data extracted from relevant articles. Pass rates describing the outcomes of 161 CS1 courses that ran in 15 different countries, across 51 institutions were extracted and analysed. An almost identical mean worldwide pass rate of 67.7% was found. Moderator analysis revealed significant, but perhaps not substantial differences in pass rates based upon: grade level, country, and class size. However, pass rates were found not to have significantly differed over time, or based upon the programming language taught in the course. This paper serves as a motivation for researchers of introductory programming education, and provides much needed quantitative evidence on the potential difficulties and failure rates of this course.","Jui-Long Hung,Morgan C.

But there is a tendency on students to rely less on the functionality offered by the LMS and use more applications that are freely available on the net. This situation is magnified in studies in which students need to interact with a set of tools that are easily installed on their personal computers. This paper shows an approach using Virtual Machines by which a set of events occurring outside of the LMS are recorded and sent to a central server in a scalable and unobtrusive manner.,K ProulxViera,,2011
10.1145/1595356.1595361,,,Diagnosing learners' problem solving strategies using learning environments with algorithmic problems in secondary education,"At schools special learning and programming environments are often used in the field of algorithm. Particularly with regard to informatics lessons in secondary education they should help novices to learn the basics of programming. In several parts of Germany (e. g. Bavaria) these fundamentals are even taught in the 7th grade, when pupils are 12 to 13 years old. Age-based designed learning and programming environments such as Karel, the robot and Kara, the programmable ladybug, are employed there, however learners still underachieve. One possible approach to improve both teaching and learning process is specifying the knowledge concerning the learners' individual problem solving strategies, when they create their solutions in consideration of the solution attempt's quality.   A goal of the research project described here is being able to identify and categorise several problem solving strategies automatically. Due to this knowledge learning and programming environments can be improved which will optimise the informatics lessons, in which they are applied. Therefore the environments must be enhanced with special analytic and diagnostic modules, whose results can be given to the learner in the form of individualized system feedback messages in the future.   In this text preliminary considerations are demonstrated. The research methodology as well as the design and the implementation of the research instruments are explained. We describe first studies, whose results are presented and discussed.","Kartinah Zen,D. N. F. Awang Iskandar,Ongkir Linang",,2008

Findings indicate that students’ self-reports may not calibrate to actual studying activity. Analyses of log file traces of studying activities provide important information for defining strategies and sequences of fine-grained studying actions. We contrast these analytic methods and illustrate how trace-based profiles of students’ self-regulated studying inform models of metacognitive monitoring, evaluation, and self-regulated adaptation.","Katrien Verbert,Erik Duval,Joris Klerkx,Sten Govaerts,Jose Luis Santos",Metacognition and Learning,2007

10.1186/s12909-016-0672-7,27215280,,Effectiveness of simulation-based nursing education depending on fidelity: a meta-analysis,"Simulation-based nursing education is an increasingly popular pedagogical approach. It provides students with opportunities to practice their clinical and decision-making skills through various real-life situational experiences. However, simulation approaches fall along a continuum ranging from low-fidelity to high-fidelity simulation. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect size of simulation-based educational interventions in nursing and compare effect sizes according to the fidelity level of the simulators through a meta-analysis. This study explores the quantitative evidence published in the electronic databases EBSCO, Medline, ScienceDirect, ERIC, RISS, and the National Assembly Library of Korea database. Using a search strategy including the search terms “nursing,” “simulation,” “human patient,” and “simulator,” we identified 2279 potentially relevant articles. Forty studies met the inclusion criteria and were retained in the analysis. This meta-analysis showed that simulation-based nursing education was effective in various learning domains, with a pooled random-effects standardized mean difference of 0.70. Subgroup analysis revealed that effect sizes were larger for high-fidelity simulation (0.86), medium-fidelity simulation (1.03), and standardized patients (0.86) than they were for low-fidelity and hybrid simulations. In terms of cognitive outcomes, the effect size was the largest for high-fidelity simulation (0.50). Regarding affective outcome, high-fidelity simulation (0.80) and standardized patients (0.73) had the largest effect sizes. These results suggest that simulation-based nursing educational interventions have strong educational effects, with particularly large effects in the psychomotor domain. Since the effect is not proportional to fidelity level, it is important to use a variety of educational interventions to meet all of the educational goals.","Kelly Rivers,Erik Harpstead,Kenneth R.

Learning strategies include any thoughts, behaviors, beliefs, or emotions that facilitate the acquisition, understanding, or later transfer of new knowledge and skills. A model is described as strategic learning that demonstrates the relationships among students' learning strategy knowledge, learning strategy skills, and self-regulation, as well as other variables that significantly impact learning and achievement. The chapter leads to an evolving focus on information processing research and models that emphasize that cognition is something that could be controlled through cognitive and metacognitive processes. One of the practical applications of these new information processing theories is in the area of memory strategies that could be used in educational settings. Research on mnemonics and advances in the understanding of associative networks pave the way for researchers to investigate different types of training that could be used to improve students' paired-associate learning. The model of what it means to be a learner is shifting from viewing the learner as a passive receptacle for knowledge to the leaner as an active, self-determined individual who processes information in complex ways.","Kelly Rivers,Kenneth R.

The model describes three inputs and outcomes (skill, will and thrill), success criteria, three phases of learning (surface, deep and transfer) and an acquiring and consolidation phase within each of the surface and deep phases. A synthesis of 228 meta-analyses led to the identification of the most effective strategies. The results indicate that there is a subset of strategies that are effective, but this effectiveness depends on the phase of the model in which they are implemented. Further, it is best not to run separate sessions on learning strategies but to embed the various strategies within the content of the subject, to be clearer about developing both surface and deep learning, and promoting their associated optimal strategies and to teach the skills of transfer of learning. The article concludes with a discussion of questions raised by the model that need further research.","Kendon J. Conrad,Everett V. Smith",,2016
10.18637/jss.v088.i03,,,Mixture Hidden Markov Models for Sequence Data: The seqHMM Package in R,"Sequence analysis is being more and more widely used for the analysis of social sequences and other multivariate categorical time series data. However, it is often complex to describe, visualize, and compare large sequence data, especially when there are multiple parallel sequences per subject. Hidden (latent) Markov models (HMMs) are able to detect underlying latent structures and they can be used in various longitudinal settings: to account for measurement error, to detect unobservable states, or to compress information across several types of observations. Extending to mixture hidden Markov models (MHMMs) allows clustering data into homogeneous subsets, with or without external covariates. 
The seqHMM package in R is designed for the efficient modeling of sequences and other categorical time series data containing one or multiple subjects with one or multiple interdependent sequences using HMMs and MHMMs. Also other restricted variants of the MHMM can be fitted, e.g., latent class models, Markov models, mixture Markov models, or even ordinary multinomial regression models with suitable parameterization of the HMM. Good graphical presentations of data and models are useful during the whole analysis process from the first glimpse at the data to model fitting and presentation of results. The package provides easy options for plotting parallel sequence data, and proposes visualizing HMMs as directed graphs.","Kevin C. Webb,Cynthia Taylor",arXiv: Computation,2019

However, there is a paucity of research examining any association between learning strategies extracted from trace data and responses to well-established self-report instruments and performance scores. This paper focuses on the link between the learning strategies identified in the trace data and student reported approaches to learning. The paper reports on the findings of a study conducted in the scope of an undergraduate engineering course (N=144) that followed a flipped classroom design. The study found that learning strategies extracted from trace data can be interpreted in terms of deep and surface approaches to learning. The detected significant links with self-report measures are with small effect sizes for both the overall deep approach to learning scale and the deep strategy scale. However, there was no observed significance linking the surface approach to learning and surface strategy nor were there significant associations with motivation scales of approaches to learning. The significant effects on academic performance were found, and consistent with the literature that used self-report instruments showing that students who followed a deep approach to learning had a significantly higher performance.","Kew Si Na,Zaidatun Tasir",Journal of learning Analytics,2017

Spatio-temporal periodic pattern mining is to find temporal regularities for interesting places. Many real world spatio-temporal phenomena present sequential and hierarchical nature. However, traditional spatio-temporal periodic pattern mining ignores the consideration of sequence, and fails to take into account inherent hierarchy. This paper proposes a hierarchical trajectory clustering based periodic pattern mining that overcomes the two common drawbacks from traditional approaches: hierarchical reference spots and consideration of sequence. We propose a new trajectory clustering algorithm which considers semantic spatio-temporal information such as direction, speed and time based on Traclus and present comparative experimental results with three popular clustering methods: Kernel function, Grid-based, and Traclus. We further extend the proposed trajectory clustering to hierarchical clustering with the use of the single linkage approach to generate a hierarchy of reference spots. Experimental results reveal various hierarchical periodic patterns, and demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms traditional reference spot detection algorithms.","Kiran L.N. Eranki,Kannan M.

While there is a rich body of literature that has extracted invaluable information from such sources, it suffers from a number of shortcomings. For instance, it has been shown that surveys often provide insight into students’ perceptions about learning rather than how students actually employ study tactics and learning strategies. Accordingly, recent research has sought to assess students’ learning strategies and, by extension, their self-regulated learning via trace data collected from digital learning environments. A number of studies have amply demonstrated the ability of educational data mining and learning analytics methods to identify patterns indicative of learning strategies within trace log data. However, many of these methods are limited in their ability to describe and interpret differences between extracted latent representations at varying levels of granularity (for instance, in terms of the underlying data of student actions and behavior). To address this limitation, the present study proposes a new methodology whereby interpretable representations of student's self-regulating behavior are derived at two theoretically inspired levels: that of learning strategies, and the study tactics that compose them.",Kirsti Ala-Mutka,IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies,2019

By leveraging historical student data, we built predictive models using students' offline (static) information including student characteristics and demographics, and online (dynamic) resources using programming and behaviour activity logs. Predictions are generated  weekly during semester. Overall, the predictive and personalised feedback helped to reduce the gap between the lower and higher-performing students. Furthermore, students praised the prediction and the personalised feedback, conveying strong recommendations for future students to use the system. We also found that students who followed their personalised guidance and recommendations performed better in examinations.","Kris M.Y. Law,Victor C. S.

10.1016/j.chb.2019.03.025,,,Analyzing multimodal multichannel data about self-regulated learning with advanced learning technologies: issues and challenges,"Abstract   Analyzing multimodal multichannel data about self-regulated learning (SRL) obtained during the use of advanced learning technologies such as intelligent tutoring systems, serious games, hypermedia, and immersive virtual learning environments is key to understanding the interplay among cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and social processes and their impact on learning, problem solving, reasoning, and conceptual understanding in learners of all ages and contexts. In this special issue of Computers in Human Behavior, we report six studies conducted by interdisciplinary teams’ use of various trace methodologies such as eye tracking, log-files, physiological data, facial expressions of emotions, screen recordings, concurrent think-alouds, and linguistic analyses of discourse. The research studies focus on how these data were analyzed using a combination of traditional statistical techniques as well as educational data-mining procedures to detect, measure, and infer cognitive, metacognitive, and social processes related to regulating the self and others across several tasks, domains, ages, and contexts. The results of these studies point to future work necessitating interdisciplinary researchers’ collaboration to use theoretically based and empirically derived approaches to collecting, measuring, and modeling multimodal multichannel SRL data to extend our current models, frameworks, and theories by making them more predictive by elucidating the nature, complexity, and temporality of underlying processes. Lastly, analyses of multimodal multichannel SRL process data can significantly augment advanced learning technologies by providing real-time, intelligent, adaptive, individualized scaffolding and feedback to address learners’ self-regulatory needs.","Kris Powers,Stacey Ecott,Leanne M.

Identifying and measuring the previous experience of students learning to program is a key to improve the teaching of programming. In this contribution, we outline an approach to measure and evaluate programming interactions with the block-based programming environment Scratch. First results, obtained with eight upper secondary school students, show that programming skills and patterns can be quantified with interaction metrics measured during program construction. The aim is a more fine-grained identification and assessment of programming skills.","Kris Powers,Stacey Ecott,Leanne M. Hirshfield",,2019

However, an assessment of students' programming skills based on the results of a programming task is not sufficient to determine all areas students are struggling with. We therefore introduce a learning analytics approach of measuring and evaluating the programming sequences of students that program with Scratch 3. With our measurement framework, it is possible to record, store and analyze programming sequences done on a publicly-available, instrumented Scratch 3 environment. Changes in the programming sequence are categorized regarding the used block types and types of program change. We conducted an exploratory programming trial with lower and upper secondary school students to investigate small-scale programming strategies in the recorded programming sequences. Our goals are to identify students in need of support and to identify recurring patterns used by students successful in the trial. Clustering with k-means makes it possible to identify struggling students based on both interacted block types and types of program changes. Recurring patterns in the programming sequences of successful students show that small-scale programming strategies are very diverse.","Kshitij Sharma,Michail N.

10.1111/bjet.12953,,,Using learning analytics in the Amazonas: understanding students’ behaviour in introductory programming,"Tools for automatic grading programming assignments, also known as Online Judges, have been widely used to support computer science (CS) courses. Nevertheless, few studies have used these tools to acquire and analyse interaction data to better understand the students’ performance and behaviours, often due to data availability or inadequate granularity. To address this problem, we propose an Online Judge called CodeBench, which allows for fine‐grained data collection of student interactions, at the level of, eg, keystrokes, number of submissions, and grades. We deployed CodeBench for 3 years (2016–18) and collected data from 2058 students from 16 introductory computer science (CS1) courses, on which we have carried out fine‐grained learning analytics, towards early detection of effective/ineffective behaviours regarding learning CS concepts. Results extract clear behavioural classes of CS1 students, significantly differentiated both semantically and statistically, enabling us to better explain how student behaviours during programming have influenced learning outcomes. Finally, we also identify behaviours that can guide novice students to improve their learning performance, which can be used for interventions. We believe this work is a step forward towards enhancing Online Judges and helping teachers and students improve their CS1 teaching/learning practices.","Kshitij Sharma,Serena Lee-Cultura,Michail Giannakos",British Journal of Educational Technology,2020
10.3390/su12187451,,,Automated assessment in programming courses: a case study during the COVID-19 era,"The COVID-19 pandemic imposed in many countries, in the short term, the interruption of face-to-face teaching activities and, in the medium term, the existence of a ‘new normal’, in which teaching methods should be able to switch from face-to-face to remote overnight. However, this flexibility can pose a great difficulty, especially in the assessment of practical courses with a high student–teacher ratio, in which the assessment tools or methods used in face-to-face learning are not ready to be adopted within a fully online environment. This article presents a case study describing the transformation of the assessment method of a programming course in higher education to a fully online format during the COVID-19 pandemic, by means of an automated student-centered assessment tool. To evaluate the new assessment method, we studied students’ interactions with the tool, as well as students’ perceptions, which were measured with two different surveys: one for the programming assignments and one for the final exam. The results show that the students’ perceptions of the assessment tool were highly positive: if using the tool had been optional, the majority of them would have chosen to use it without a doubt, and they would like other courses to involve a tool like the one presented in this article. A discussion about the use of this tool in subsequent years in the same and related courses is also presented, analyzing the sustainability of this new assessment method.","Kshitij Sharma,Zacharoula K.

10.1109/access.2020.3024102,,,Analysis of Learning Behavior in an Automated Programming Assessment Environment: A Code Quality Perspective,"Automated programming assessment systems are useful tools to track the learning progress of students automatically and thereby reduce the workload of educators. They can also be used to gain insights into how students learn, making it easier to formulate strategies aimed at enhancing learning performance. Rather than functional code which is always inspected, code quality remains an essential aspect to which not many educators consider when designing an automated programming assessment system. In this study, we applied data mining techniques to analyze the results of an automated assessment system to reveal unexpressed patterns in code quality improvement that are predictive of final achievements in the course. Cluster analysis is first utilized to categorize students according to their learning behavior and outcomes. Cluster profile analysis is then leveraged to highlight actionable factors that could affect their final grades. Finally, the same factors are employed to construct a classification model by which to make early predictions of the students' final results. Our empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme in providing valuable insights into the learning behaviors of students in novice programming courses, especially in code quality assurance, which could be used to enhance programming performance at the university level.","Kuba Karpierz,Steven A.

One approach to testing generalizability of a method is to apply it consistently in different learning contexts. This study extends a previously published work by examining the generalizability of a learning analytics method proposed for detecting learning tactics and strategies from trace data. The method was applied to the datasets collected in three different course designs and delivery modalities, including flipped classroom, blended learning, and massive open online course. The proposed method combines process mining and sequence analysis. The detected learning strategies are explored in terms of their association with academic performance. The results indicate the applicability of the proposed method across different learning contexts. Moreover, the findings contribute to the understanding of the learning tactics and strategies identified in the trace data: learning tactics proved to be responsive to the course design, whereas learning strategies were found to be more sensitive to the delivery modalities than to the course design. These findings, well aligned with self-regulated learning theory, highlight the association of learning contexts with the choice of learning tactics and strategies.","Kukka-Maaria Polso,Heta Tuominen,Arto Hellas,Petri Ihantola",Journal of learning Analytics,2020

10.20944/preprints202104.0404.v1,,,Putting It All Together: Combining Learning Analytics Methods and Data Sources to Understand Students’ Approaches to Learning Programming,"Learning programming is a complex and challenging task for many students. It involves both understanding theoretical concepts and acquiring practical skills. Hence, analyzing learners’ data from online learning environments alone fails to capture the full breadth of students’ actions if part of their learning process takes place elsewhere. Moreover, existing studies on learning analytics applied to programming education have mainly relied on frequency analysis to classify students according to their approach to programming or to predict academic achievement. However, frequency analysis provides limited insights into the individual time-related characteristics of the learning process. The current study examines students’ strategies when learning programming, combining data from the learning management system and from an automated assessment tool used to support students while solving the programming assignments. The study included the data of 292 engineering students (228 men and 64 women, aged 20–26) from the two aforementioned sources. To gain an in-depth understanding of students’ learning process as well as of the types of learners, we used learning analytics methods that account for the temporal order of learning actions. Our results show that students have special preferences for specific learning resources when learning programming, namely, slides that support search, and copy and paste. We also found that videos are relatively less consumed by students, especially while working on programming assignments. Lastly, students resort to course forums to seek help only when they struggle.",Kurt VanLehn,,2021

However, most of the available studies have focused on a single course. Therefore, little is known about how students’ online engagement evolves over time. Previous research in face-to-face settings has shown that early disengagement has negative consequences on students’ academic achievement and graduation rates. This study examines the longitudinal trajectory of students’ online engagement throughout a complete college degree. The study followed 99 students over 4 years of college education including all their course data (15 courses and 1383 course enrollments). Students’ engagement states for each course enrollment were identified through Latent Class Analysis (LCA). Students who were not engaged at least one course in the first term was labeled as “Early Disengagement”, whereas the remaining students were labeled as “Early Engagement”. The two groups of students were analyzed using sequence pattern mining methods. The stability (persistence of the engagement state), transition (ascending to a higher engagement state or descending to a lower state), and typology of each group trajectory of engagement are described in this study. Our results show that early disengagement is linked to higher rates of dropout, lower scores, and lower graduation rates whereas early engagement is relatively stable. Our findings indicate that it is critical to proactively address early disengagement during a program, watch the alarming signs such as presence of disengagement during the first courses, declining engagement along the program, or history of frequent disengagement states.","Kyu Han Koh,Ashok Basawapatna,Hilarie Nickerson,Alexander Repenning",,2021

Such factors may result in either a stable, declining or fluctuating engagement trajectory. While research on online engagement is abundant, most authors have examined student engagement in a single course or two. Little research has been devoted to studying online longitudinal engagement, i.e., the evolution of student engagement over a full educational program. This learning analytics study examines the engagement states (sequences, successions, stability, and transitions) of 106 students in 1396 course enrollments over a full program. All data of students enrolled in the academic year 2014–2015, and their subsequent data in 2015–2016, 2016–2017, and 2017–2018 (15 courses) were collected. The engagement states were clustered using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to uncover the hidden engagement trajectories which resulted in a mostly-engaged (33% of students), an intermediate (39.6%), and a troubled (27.4%) trajectory. The mostly-engaged trajectory was stable with infrequent changes, scored the highest, and was less likely to drop out. The troubled trajectory showed early disengagement, frequent dropouts and scored the lowest grades. The results of our study show how to identify early program disengagement (activities within the third decile) and when students may drop out (first year and early second year).","kyung kyu kim,Lee， Jong Yun,Jong Yun Lee",Computers in Education,2021

The ability to pinpoint students who might soon decide to drop out of a given academic program allows those in charge to not only understand the causes for this undesired outcome, but it also provides room for the development of early intervention systems. While making such inferences based on academic performance data alone is certainly possible, we claim that in many cases there is no substantial correlation between how well a student performs and his or her decision to withdraw. This is specially true when the overall set of students has a relatively similar academic performance. To address this issue, we derive measurements of engagement from students' electronic portfolios and show how these features can be effectively used to augment the quality of predictions.","Leo C.

Kolb's learning style inventory was used in this study to determine a learner's learning type: 'Diverger', 'Assimilator', 'Converger', and 'Accommodator'. Social Learning Theory was also used to define four participation types. These types in turn were used to describe the learning associated with the use of online forums: 'Replier', 'Asker', 'Watcher', and 'No activity'. A total of 144 students participated in this experiment as part of a half semester ASP.NET programming language learning courses. The course contained an online forum for supporting the students' social activities and participation. In this study, 'learning score' and 'satisfaction' were used to measure learning performance. The results of this study were the following: (1) different learning styles were associated with significantly different learning scores and that the 'Accommodator' style was associated with superior learning scores; (2) participation types were also associated with significantly different learning scores and that the 'Replier' type is associated with superior learning scores; (3) learning satisfaction is not significantly different among the different learning styles or different participation types, but the average is significantly higher than average values (3.5) of 7-point Likert scale; (4) there is no significant association between learning styles and participation types. Explanations and discussions of these results are offered. Based on the results of this study, we propose that programming language learning, supported with online forums and students' active participation, increases learning performance as measured by student learning scores.","Leo Porter,Cynthia Taylor,Kevin C.

The study illustrates the differences in predictive power and significant predictors between course-specific models and generalized predictive models. The results suggest that it is imperative for learning analytics research to account for the diverse ways technology is adopted and applied in course-specific contexts. The differences in technology use, especially those related to whether and how learners use the learning management system, require consideration before the log-data can be merged to create a generalized model for predicting academic success. A lack of attention to instructional conditions can lead to an over or under estimation of the effects of LMS features on students' academic success.

This demand has spurred the provision of a number of new and/or improved approaches to software development, with perhaps the most prominent being object-orientation (OO). In addition, the focus on process improvement has increased the demand for software measures, or metrics with which to manage the process. The need for such metrics is particularly acute when an organization is adopting a new technology for which established practices have yet to be developed. This research addresses these needs through the development and implementation of a new suite of metrics for OO design. Metrics developed in previous research, while contributing to the field's understanding of software development processes, have generally been subject to serious criticisms, including the lack of a theoretical base. Following Wand and Weber (1989), the theoretical base chosen for the metrics was the ontology of Bunge (1977). Six design metrics are developed, and then analytically evaluated against Weyuker's (1988) proposed set of measurement principles. An automated data collection tool was then developed and implemented to collect an empirical sample of these metrics at two field sites in order to demonstrate their feasibility and suggest ways in which managers may use these metrics for process improvement. >","LoråsMadeleine,LoråsMadeleine,Madeleine Lorås,Guttorm Sindre,SindreGuttorm,SindreGuttorm,TrættebergHallvard,Hallvard Trætteberg,TrættebergHallvard,Trond Aalberg,AalbergTrond,AalbergTrond",,2015

This approach helps the instructor to easily find out quality issues in student programs. Feedback to such assignments can be provided using the guidelines which we will be discussing. We also perform an experimental study on programming assignments of sophomore students who were enrolled in an object-oriented programming course to validate our approach.","Lorin W.

ITAP uses state abstraction, path construction, and state reification to automatically generate personalized hints for students, even when given states that have not occurred in the data before. We provide a detailed description of the system’s implementation and perform a technical evaluation on a small set of data to determine the effectiveness of the component algorithms and ITAP’s potential for self-improvement. The results show that ITAP is capable of producing hints for almost any given state after being given only a single reference solution, and that it can improve its performance by collecting data over time.","Louise P.

Consequently there is a need to increase the data literacy of computer science students. Data science is a relatively new area within computer science and the curriculum is rapidly evolving along with the tools required to perform analytics which students need to learn how to effectively use. To address the needs of students learning key data science and analytics skills we propose augmenting existing data science curriculums with hackathon events that focus on data also known as datathons. In this paper we present our experience at hosting and running four datathons that involved students and members from the community coming together to solve challenging problems with data from not-for-profit social good organizations and publicly open data. Our reported experience from our datathons will help inform other academics and community groups who also wish to host datathons to help facilitate their students and members to learn key data science and analytics skills.,Luís Macedo,,2016

Current assessment practices in introductory courses consist predominantly of questions that involve a multitude of different concepts and facts. Students with fragile knowledge in any of the areas required may be unable to produce a working solution, even when they may know most of the required material. These assessments also make it difficult for a teacher to distinguish between the specific information that a student does and does not know.   In this paper, we analyse examination questions used to assess novice programming at the syntax level and describe the extent to which each syntax component is used across the various examination questions. We also explore the degree to which questions involve multiple syntax elements as an indicator of how independently concepts are examined.","Ma. Mercedes T. Rodrigo,Ryan S. Baker",,2017

Syntax errors pose a significant challenge for testcase-based grading as it is difficult to differentiate between a submission that is almost correct and has some minor syntax errors and another submission that is completely off-the-mark. GradeIT also uses program repair to help in grading submissions that do not compile. This enables running testcases on submissions containing minor syntax errors, thereby awarding partial marks for these submissions (which, without repair, do not compile successfully and, hence, do not pass any testcase). Our experiments on 15613 submissions show that GradeIT results are comparable to manual grading by teaching assistants (TAs), and do not suffer from unintentional variability that happens when multiple TAs grade the same assignment. The repairs performed by GradeIT enabled successful compilation of 56% of the submissions having compilation errors, and resulted in an improvement in marks for 11% of these submissions.","Mack Sweeney,Jaime Lester,Huzefa Rangwala,Aditya Johri",,2017

We wish to extend the availability of such critique through automation, capturing the essence of interaction between student and instructor as closely as possible. Integrated Development Environments and Automated Grading Systems provide constant feedback through static analysis and unit testing. But we also wish to tailor automated feedback to acknowledge commonly recurring issues with novice programmers, in keeping with the practice of a human instructor. We argue that the kinds of mistakes that novice programmers make, and the way they are reported to the novices, deserve special care. In this paper we provide examples of early programming antipatterns that have arisen from our teaching experience, and describe different ways of identifying and dealing with them automatically through our tool WebTA. Novice students may produce code that is close to a correct solution but contains syntactic errors; WebTA attempts to salvage the promising portions of the student's submission and suggest repairs that are more meaningful than typical compiler error messages. Alternatively, a student misunderstanding may result in well-formed code that passes unit tests yet contains clear design flaws; through additional analysis, WebTA can identify and flag them. Finally, certain types of antipattern can be anticipated and flagged by the instructor, based on the context of the course and the programming exercise; WebTA allows for customizable critique triggers and messages.","Maria Perifanou,Panagiotis Kosmas,Andri Ioannou,Symeon Retalis",,2019

We found that: 1) they must empathize with a diverse array of student backgrounds and expectations, 2) they teach technical workflows that integrate authentic practices surrounding code, data, and communication, 3) they face challenges involving authenticity versus abstraction in software setup, finding and curating pedagogically-relevant datasets, and acclimating students to live with uncertainty in data analysis.

In spite of this, most evidence of student behavior and its relationship to performance is anecdotal. The advent of large-scale courses which use online tools for delivering course content, monitoring the programming environment, and providing automatic feedback as well as grading now makes it possible to dive into the data and develop data-driven methods for understanding how a student's approach to an assignment---from their first exposure to the description of the problem to their final submission of their completed assignment---influences their final performance.   This study is a first look at a subset of the data collected from a project-based, online, upper-level course on cloud computing. We examine three raw data streams which include information on the time students spend on reading the project write-up, the timing, grades, and number of submissions they make, and the cloud resources used (both time and cost) in solving the assignment. Using these and several synthetic metrics we were surprised to find that there are few behaviors that are highly correlated to student success. Instead, we find that there is a strong correlation between students who continually apply consistent behaviors over the course of the semester to good final performance in the course. From this we use LASSO to create a predictor (adjusted R2=.48) of final performance based on two kinds of consistency measures across 15 metrics.","Mark Sherman,Fred Martin",,2019

10.1145/3291279.3339420,,,An Evaluation of the Impact of Automated Programming Hints on Performance and Learning,"A growing body of work has explored how to automatically generate hints for novice programmers, and many programming environments now employ these hints. However, few studies have investigated the efficacy of automated programming hints for improving performance and learning, how and when novices find these hints beneficial, and the tradeoffs that exist between different types of hints. In this work, we explored the efficacy of next-step code hints with 2 complementary features: textual explanations and self-explanation prompts. We conducted two studies in which novices completed two programming tasks in a block-based programming environment with automated hints. In Study 1, 10 undergraduate students completed 2 programming tasks with a variety of hint types, and we interviewed them to understand their perceptions of the affordances of each hint type. For Study 2, we recruited a convenience sample of participants without programming experience from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We conducted a randomized experiment comparing the effects of hints' types on learners' performance and performance on a subsequent task without hints. We found that code hints with textual explanations significantly improved immediate programming performance. However, these hints only improved performance in a subsequent post-test task with similar objectives, when they were combined with self-explanation prompts. These results provide design insights into how automatically generated code hints can be improved with textual explanations and prompts to self-explain, and provide evidence about when and how these hints can improve programming performance and learning.","Martin Drlík,Jan Skalka,Peter Svec,Jozef Kapusta",,2019

10.1109/seaa.2015.20,,,On the Coherence between Comments and Implementations in Source Code,"Source code comments provide useful information on the implementation of a software and on the intent behind design decisions and goals. Writing informative and useful comments is far from being a trivial task. Moreover, source code comments tend to remain mostly unchanged during maintenance activities. As a consequence, the information provided in the comment of a method and in its corresponding implementation may be not coherent with each other (i.e., The comment does not properly describe the implementation). In this paper, we present the results of a manual assessment on the coherence between comments and implementations of 3636 methods, gathered from 3 Java open source software systems (for one of these systems, we considered 2 different subsequent versions). Resulting evaluations have been collected in a dataset, we made publicly available on the web. The defined protocol used for the creation of this dataset is also described. This lets researchers evaluate the goodness of our dataset and eases its future possible extensions. Another contribution of our paper consists in investigating on a possible link between coherence and lexical similarity between source code and comments. Our preliminary outcomes suggest that this similarity is higher in case the comment of methods and their implementations are coherent. However, the obtained similarity values are generally low and are not much higher than those for non-coherent method implementations and comments.","Matthew J. Howard,Samir Gupta,Lori Pollock,K.

The high level of drop out percentage has been a problem at Helsinki University of Technology for many years. This course has yearly enrolment of 500-600 students and the drop out percentage has varied from 30-50 percents.Since we did not have clear picture of drop out reasons we conducted a qualitative interview research in which 18 dropouts from the CS1 course were interviewed. The reasons of drop out were categorized and, in addition, each case was investigated individually. This procedure enabled us to both list the reasons and to reveal the cumulative nature of drop out reasons.The results indicate that several reasons affect students' decision to quit the CS1 course. The most frequent reasons were the lack of time and the lack of motivation. However, both of these reasons were in turn affected by factors, such as the perceived difficulty of the course, general difficulties with time managing and planning studies, or the decision to prefer something else. Furthermore, low comfort level and plagiarism played a role in drop out. In addition, drop out reasons cumulated.This study shows that the complexity and large variety of factors involved in students' decision to drop the course. This indicates that simple actions to improve teaching or organization on a CS1 course to reduce drop out may be ineffective. Efficient intervention to the problem apparently requires a combination of many different actions that take into consideration the versatile nature of reasons involved in drop out.","Max Kesselbacher,Andreas Bollin",,2006

Programming is more than just coding, for, it exposes students to computational thinking which involves problem-solving using computer science concepts like abstraction and decomposition. Even for non-computing majors, computational thinking is applicable and useful in their daily lives. The three dimensions of computational thinking are computational concepts, computational practices and computational perspectives. In recent years, the availability of free and user-friendly programming languages has fuelled the interest of researchers and educators to explore how computational thinking can be introduced in K-12 contexts. Through an analysis of 27 available intervention studies, this paper presents the current trends of empirical research in the development of computational thinking through programming and suggests possible research and instructional implications. From the review, we propose that more K-12 intervention studies centering on computational practices and computational perspectives could be conducted in the regular classroom. To better examine these two dimensions, students could be asked to verbalize their thought process using think aloud protocol while programming and their on-screen programming activity could be captured and analyzed. Predetermined categories based on both past and recent programming studies could be used to guide the analysis of the qualitative data. As for the instructional implication, it is proposed that a constructionism-based problem-solving learning environment, with information processing, scaffolding and reflection activities, could be designed to foster computational practices and computational perspectives.","Max Kesselbacher,Andreas Bollin",Computers in Human Behavior,2014

Because different people likely created the queries and various artifacts, the effectiveness of these tools is often improved by expanding queries and adding related words to textual artifact representations. Synonyms are particularly useful to overcome the mismatch in vocabularies, as well as other word relations that indicate semantic similarity. However, experience shows that many words are semantically similar in computer science situations, but not in typical natural language documents. In this paper, we present an automatic technique to mine semantically similar words, particularly in the software context. We leverage the role of leading comments for methods and programmer conventions in writing them. Our evaluation of our mined related comment-code word mappings that do not already occur in WordNet are indeed viewed as computer science, semantically-similar word pairs in high proportions.","Maxim Rabinovich,Mitchell Stern,Daniel Klein",,2013

Detecting OS concurrency bugs is challenging due to the complexity of the OS synchronization, particularly with the presence of the OS specific interrupt context. Existing dynamic concurrency bug detection techniques are designed for user level applications and cannot be applied to operating systems.   To detect OS concurrency bugs, we proposed a new type of annotations - interrupt related annotations - and generated 96,821 such annotations for the Linux kernel with little manual effort. These annotations have been used to automatically detect 9 real OS concurrency bugs (7 of which were previously unknown). Two of the key techniques that make the above contributions possible are: (1) using a hybrid approach to extract annotations from both code and comments written in natural language to achieve better coverage and accuracy in annotation extraction and bug detection; and (2) automatically propagating annotations to caller functions to improve annotating and bug detection. These two techniques are general and can be applied to non-OS code, code written in other programming languages such as Java, and for extracting other types of specifications.","Michael J.

10.1109/tkde.2016.2571687,,,Understand Short Texts by Harvesting and Analyzing Semantic Knowledge,"Understanding short texts is crucial to many applications, but challenges abound. First, short texts do not always observe the syntax of a written language. As a result, traditional natural language processing tools, ranging from part-of-speech tagging to dependency parsing, cannot be easily applied. Second, short texts usually do not contain sufficient statistical signals to support many state-of-the-art approaches for text mining such as topic modeling. Third, short texts are more ambiguous and noisy, and are generated in an enormous volume, which further increases the difficulty to handle them. We argue that semantic knowledge is required in order to better understand short texts. In this work, we build a prototype system for short text understanding which exploits semantic knowledge provided by a well-known knowledgebase and automatically harvested from a web corpus. Our knowledge-intensive approaches disrupt traditional methods for tasks such as text segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and concept labeling, in the sense that we focus on semantics in all these tasks. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation on real-life data. The results show that semantic knowledge is indispensable for short text understanding, and our knowledge-intensive approaches are both effective and efficient in discovering semantics of short texts.","Michael McCracken,Vicki Almstrum,Danny Diaz,Mark Guzdial,Dianne Hagan,Yifat Ben-David Kolikant,Cary Laxer,Lynda Thomas,Ian Utting,Tadeusz Wilusz",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017

The results show that programming learners indeed seek for information from discussion forums by actively search and read progressively according to course schedule topics. Advanced students consistently perform query refinements, examine search results and commit to read, however, novices do not.

,,,LightGBM: a highly efficient gradient boosting decision tree,"Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB LightGBM. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.","Mikko-Jussi Laakso,Erkki Kaila,Teemu Rajala,Teemu Rajala",,2017

Most of the annotated documentations are predominantly being used as the archive of the coding events for limited developers. We hypothesize that these annotations captured mass amount of valuable information which can be utilized to identify similar codes or to examine code quality. However, due to the annotating behaviors vary and the language composition can be complex, this work sets out to investigate a systematic method to examine the annotation semantics and their relations with codes. We designed a semantic parser to extract concepts from codes and the corresponding annotations. Additionally, text mining techniques are applied to summarize linguistic features from the annotations. We then build models to predict concepts in programming code annotations. Results show that the proposed semantic modeling method achieved a higher performance compared to a random guessed baseline.","Miltiadis Allamanis,Earl T. Barr,Christian Bird,Charles Sutton",,2018

A linear regression revealed that student-student interaction was the most powerful predictor of students' intention to persist in the major beyond the introductory course. Other factors predicting intention to persist were pace/workload/prior experience and male gender. The findings suggest that computer science departments interested in increasing retention of students set structured expectations for student-student interaction in ways that integrate peer involvement as a mainstream activity rather than making it optional or extracurricular.

The identification, documentation, and validation of misconceptions is a long and time-consuming work, usually carried out using iterative cycles of students answering open-ended questionnaires, interviews with instructors and students, exam analysis, and discussion with experts. A comprehensive list of validated misconceptions in some subject can be used to build formal evaluation methods like the Concept Inventory (CI), a multiple-choice questionnaire that is usually performed as pre-post tests in order to assess any change in student understanding. In CS1, validated misconceptions were identified and documented in C and Python programming languages. Although there are studies related to misconceptions in the Java language, these misconceptions lack the formality, comprehensiveness, and robustness of their C and Python counterparts. On this work, we propose a methodology to adapt the validated misconceptions in C and Python to Java. Initially, through the analysis of an initial list of 33 misconceptions in C and 28 in Python, we identified and documented in an antipattern format 31 possible misconceptions in Java. We then developed a final term exam, composed of 7 open-ended questions, in which each question was designed to address some of the misconceptions covered in the course (N=27). Through the analysis of the exams answers (N = 69 students), it was possible to validate 22 of the misconceptions (81%).

10.1145/3344429.3372502,,,Pass Rates in Introductory Programming and in other STEM Disciplines,"Vast numbers of publications in computing education begin with the premise that programming is hard to learn and hard to teach. Many papers note that failure rates in computing courses, and particularly in introductory programming courses, are higher than their institutions would like. Two distinct research projects in 2007 and 2014 concluded that average success rates in introductory programming courses world-wide were in the region of 67%, and a recent replication of the first project found an average pass rate of about 72%. The authors of those studies concluded that there was little evidence that failure rates in introductory programming were concerningly high.   However, there is no absolute scale by which pass or failure rates are measured, so whether a failure rate is concerningly high will depend on what that rate is compared against. As computing is typically considered to be a STEM subject, this paper considers how pass rates for introductory programming courses compare with those for other introductory STEM courses. A comparison of this sort could prove useful in demonstrating whether the pass rates are comparatively low, and if so, how widespread such findings are.   This paper is the report of an ITiCSE working group that gathered information on pass rates from several institutions to determine whether prior results can be confirmed, and conducted a detailed comparison of pass rates in introductory programming courses with pass rates in introductory courses in other STEM disciplines.   The group found that pass rates in introductory programming courses appear to average about 75%; that there is some evidence that they sit at the low end of the range of pass rates in introductory STEM courses; and that pass rates both in introductory programming and in other introductory STEM courses appear to have remained fairly stable over the past five years. All of these findings must be regarded with some caution, for reasons that are explained in the paper. Despite the lack of evidence that pass rates are substantially lower than in other STEM courses, there is still scope to improve the pass rates of introductory programming courses, and future research should continue to investigate ways of improving student learning in introductory programming courses.","Nina Iten,Dominik Petko",,2019

This article proposes metrics for quantifying changes throughout the evolution of formal software specifications in long living systems. Formal specifications play an important role in the software development life-cycle by supporting refinement and proof and by providing a basis for comprehension and maintenance activities. However, specifications also undergo evolutionary changes, and these changes are hard to assess because of a lack of suitable measures.



This paper proposes and analyzes a set of measures for estimating aspects of a specification's complexity and quality. The measures are based on existing measures for source code, but they have been redefined in the scope of formal Z specifications. Geared towards Z, they are then evaluated concerning their expressiveness by a case study that comprises more than 65,000 lines of specification text. Finally, the usability of the measures is demonstrated on the Z specification of the Web Service Definition Language during its evolution over a period of about 3years.

Coupling and Cohesion metrics, particularly quantitative cohesion metrics, have the potential to aid in this identification and to measure progress. The most extensive work on such metrics is with slice-based cohesion metrics. While their use of semantic dependence information should make them an excellent choice for cohesion measurement, their wide spread use has been impeded in part by a lack of empirical study.   Recent advances in software tools make, for the first time, a large-scale empirical study of slice-based cohesion and coupling metrics possible. Four results from such a study are presented. First, “head-to-head” qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the metrics identify which metrics provide similar views of a program and which provide unique views of a program. This study includes statistical analysis showing that slice-based metrics are not proxies for simple size-based metrics such as lines of code. Second, two longitudinal studies show that slice-based metrics quantify the deterioration of a program as it ages. This serves to validate the metrics: the metrics quantify the degradation that exists during development; turning this around, the metrics can be used to measure the progress of a reengineering effort. Third, baseline values for slice-based metrics are provided. These values act as targets for reengineering efforts with modules having values outside the expected range being the most in need of attention. Finally, slice-based coupling is correlated and compared with slice-based cohesion.","Päivi Kinnunen,Lauri Malmi",ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology,2007

The measures are then assessed by taking a critical look at their sensitiveness in respect to modifications on the specification source. The presented study shows that slice-based coupling and cohesion measures have the potential to be used as quality indicators for specifications as they reflect the changes in the structure of a specification as accustomed from their program-related pendants.,Paul R.

This knowledge can be used to inform decisions related to course and tool design and pedagogy, and to further engage students and guide those at risk of failure. This working group report provides an overview of the body of knowledge regarding the use of educational data mining and learning analytics focused on the teaching and learning of programming. In a literature survey on mining students' programming processes for 2005-2015, we observe a significant increase in work related to the field. However, the majority of the studies focus on simplistic metric analysis and are conducted within a single institution and a single course. This indicates the existence of further avenues of research and a critical need for validation and replication to better understand the various contributing factors and the reasons why certain results occur. We introduce a novel taxonomy to analyse replicating studies and discuss the importance of replicating and reproducing previous work. We describe what is the state of the art in collecting and sharing programming data. To better understand the challenges involved in replicating or reproducing existing studies, we report our experiences from three case studies using programming data. Finally, we present a discussion of future directions for the education and research community.","Pauli Virtanen,Ralf Gommers,Travis E.

However, less attention has been paid to the actual code that students produce. In this paper, we investigate programming data by using learning curve analysis to determine which programming elements students struggle with the most when learning in Python. Our analysis extends the traditional use of learning curve analysis to include less structured data, and also reveals new possibilities for when to teach students new programming concepts. One particular discovery is that while we find evidence of student learning in some cases (for example, in function definitions and comparisons), there are other programming elements which do not demonstrate typical learning. In those cases, we discuss how further changes to the model could affect both demonstrated learning and our understanding of the different concepts that students learn.",Paulo Blikstein,,2016

Conventional classroom teaching begins with declarative knowledge concepts followed by program writing skills. As a result students attempt to memorise typical program codes instead of writing a fresh code applying the programming concepts. We have applied Program Slicing Technique as a instructional methodology to improve the basic programming skills of the novices. Slicing technique has been widely used in software testing, debugging and software assessment. Results of our study show that slicing technique has helped in improving program understanding and clarification of misconceptions encountered while coding a program.

This has led to increased interest in the field of learning analytics, which is concerned with leveraging learning process data in order to better understand, and ultimately to improve, teaching and learning. In computing education, the logical place to collect learning process data is through integrated development environments (IDEs), where computing students typically spend large amounts of time working on programming assignments. While the primary purpose of IDEs is to support computer programming, they might also be used as a mechanism for delivering learning interventions designed to enhance student learning. The possibility of using IDEs both to collect learning process data, and to strategically intervene in the learning process, suggests an exciting design space for computing education research: that of IDE-based learning analytics. In order to facilitate the systematic exploration of this design space, we present an IDE-based data analytics process model with four primary activities: (1) Collect data, (2) Analyze data, (3) Design intervention, and (4) Deliver intervention. For each activity, we identify key design dimensions and review relevant computing education literature. To provide guidance on designing effective interventions, we describe four relevant learning theories, and consider their implications for design. Based on our review, we present a call-to-action for future research into IDE-based learning analytics.","PedregosaFabian,VaroquauxGaël,GramfortAlexandre,MichelVincent,ThirionBertrand,GriselOlivier,BlondelMathieu,PrettenhoferPeter,WeissRon,DubourgVincent,VanderplasJake,PassosAlexandre,CournapeauDavid,BrucherMatthieu,PerrotMatthieu,DuchesnayÉdouard",ACM Transactions on Computing Education,2017

,,,Program slicing,"Program slicing is a method used by experienced computer programmers for abstracting from programs. Starting from a subset of a program's behavior, slicing reduces that program to a minimal form which still produces that behavior. The reduced program, called a “slice”, is an independent program guaranteed to faithfully represent the original program within the domain of the specified subset of behavior.   Finding a slice is in general unsolvable. A dataflow algorithm is presented for approximating slices when the behavior subset is specified as the values of a set of variables at a statement. Experimental evidence is presented that these slices are used by programmers during debugging. Experience with two automatic slicing tools is summarized. New measures of program complexity are suggested based on the organization of a program's slices.","Pedro Manuel Moreno-Marcos,Carlos Alario-Hoyos,Pedro J. Muñoz-Merino,Carlos Delgado Kloos",,1981

Sparsification has multiple applications, such as, speeding up graph-mining algorithms, graph visualization, as well as identifying the important network edges. In this paper we consider a novel formulation of the network-sparsification problem. In addition to the network, we also consider as input a set of communities. The goal is to sparsify the network so as to preserve the network structure with respect to the given communities. We introduce two variants of the community-aware sparsification problem, leading to sparsifiers that satisfy different connectedness community properties.

In this paper, we present a comparative study on the effectiveness of educational data mining techniques to early predict students likely to fail in introductory programming courses. Although several works have analyzed these techniques to identify students' academic failures, our study differs from existing ones as follows: (i) we investigate the effectiveness of such techniques to identify students likely to fail at early enough stage for action to be taken to reduce the failure rate; (ii) we analyse the impact of data preprocessing and algorithms fine-tuning tasks, on the effectiveness of the mentioned techniques. In our study we evaluated the effectiveness of four prediction techniques on two different and independent data sources on introductory programming courses available from a Brazilian Public University: one comes from distance education and the other from on-campus. The results showed that the techniques analyzed in our study are able to early identify students likely to fail, the effectiveness of some of these techniques is improved after applying the data preprocessing and/or algorithms fine-tuning, and the support vector machine technique outperforms the other ones in a statistically significant way.

This paper aims to present the results of the survey conducted at the Ural State University of Economics and Ural Federal University (Yekaterinburg, Russia) on student-focused quality indicators: interaction and collaboration; instructional design and delivery; student assessment; student support services. Over 800 degree students (n = 830) involved in distance learning programs responded to a 26-question on-line survey to identify the areas that the university administrators, staff, and technicians can improve upon to ensure high quality of online distance education delivery. We found that although degree students overall positively evaluate their distance learning experiences; they face some learning challenges especially in regard to effective teaching practices and communication patterns. The findings support the prediction that the faculty plays crucial role in knowledge construction and can be of use for all tertiary sector stakeholders in exploring solutions to maximize the ICT potential in distance tertiary education.","Petri Ihantola,Petri Ihantola,Andrew Petersen",Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences,2017

In prior work, we developed a statistical model that accurately predicts students' homework grades. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the paths that students take through the programming states on which our statistical model is based, and their overall course achievement. Examining the frequency of the most common transition paths revealed significant differences between students who earned A's, B's, and C's in a CS 2 course.

,,,Cleaning large correlation matrices: tools from random matrix theory,"This review covers recent results concerning the estimation of large covariance matrices using tools from Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We introduce several RMT methods and analytical techniques, such as the Replica formalism and Free Probability, with an emphasis on the Marchenko-Pastur equation that provides information on the resolvent of multiplicatively corrupted noisy matrices. Special care is devoted to the statistics of the eigenvectors of the empirical correlation matrix, which turn out to be crucial for many applications. We show in particular how these results can be used to build consistent ""Rotationally Invariant"" estimators (RIE) for large correlation matrices when there is no prior on the structure of the underlying process. The last part of this review is dedicated to some real-world applications within financial markets as a case in point. We establish empirically the efficacy of the RIE framework, which is found to be superior in this case to all previously proposed methods. The case of additively (rather than multiplicatively) corrupted noisy matrices is also dealt with in a special Appendix. Several open problems and interesting technical developments are discussed throughout the paper.","Phil Sands,Aman Yadav",,2017

A large number of learners globally enrol in such courses. Despite the flexible accessibility, results indicate that the completion rate is quite low. Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics are emerging fields of research that aim to enhance the delivery of education through the application of various statistical and machine learning approaches. An extensive literature survey indicates that no significant research is available within the area of MOOC data analysis, in particular considering the behavioural patterns of users. In this paper, therefore, two sets of features, based on learner behavioural patterns, were compared in terms of their suitability for predicting the course outcome of learners participating in MOOCs. Our Exploratory Data Analysis demonstrates that there is strong correlation between click stream actions and successful learner outcomes. Various Machine Learning algorithms have been applied to enhance the accuracy of classifier models. Simulation results from our investigation have shown that Random Forest achieved viable performance for our prediction problem, obtaining the highest performance of the models tested. Conversely, Linear Discriminant Analysis achieved the lowest relative performance, though represented only a marginal reduction in performance relative to the Random Forest.","Phillip L.

In prior research, we explored the relationship between (a) students’ programming behaviors and course outcomes, and (b) students’ participation within an online social learning environment and course outcomes. In both studies, we developed statistical measures derived from our data that significantly correlate with students’ course grades. Encouraged both by social theories of learning and a desire to improve the accuracy of our statistical models, we explore here the impact of incorporating our predictive measure derived from social behavior into three separate predictive measures derived from programming behaviors. We find that, in combining the measures, we are able to improve the overall predictive power of each measure. This finding affirms the importance of social interaction in the learning process, and provides evidence that predictive models derived from multiple sources of learning process data can provide significantly better predictive power by accounting for multiple factors responsible for student success.","Qian Ren,Xiao Peng,Xiaoyu Liu,Qiao Zheng,Ting He,Die Hu,Xuelian Jiang,Linglin Zhang",ACM Transactions on Computing Education,2017

Results show there is strong interest in predicting dropouts in MOOCs. A variety of predictive models are used, though regression and support vector machines stand out. There is also wide variety in the choice of prediction features, but clickstream data about platform use stands out. Future research should focus on developing and applying predictive models that can be used in more heterogeneous contexts (in terms of platforms, thematic areas, and course durations), on predicting new outcomes and making connections among them (e.g., predicting learners’ expectancies), on enhancing the predictive power of current models by improving algorithms or adding novel higher-order features (e.g., efficiency, constancy, etc.).","R.

One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.","Raghad Al-Shabandar,Abir Jaafar Hussain,Andy Laws,Robert Keight,Janet Lunn,Naeem Radi",Scientific Reports,2019
,,,Predicting Math Performance Using Natural Language Processing Tools.,"A number of studies have demonstrated links between linguistic knowledge and performance in math. Studies examining these links in first language speakers of English have traditionally relied on correlational analyses between linguistic knowledge tests and standardized math tests. For second language (L2) speakers, the majority of studies have compared math performance between proficient and non-proficient speakers of English. In this study, we take a novel approach and examine the linguistic features of student language while they are engaged in collaborative problem solving within an on-line math tutoring system. We transcribe the students' speech and use natural language processing tools to extract linguistic information related to text cohesion, lexical sophistication, and sentiment. Our criterion variables are individuals' pretest and posttest math performance scores. In addition to examining relations between linguistic features of student language production and math scores, we also control for a number of non-linguistic factors including gender, age, grade, school, and content focus (procedural versus conceptual). Linear mixed effect modeling indicates that non-linguistic factors are not predictive of math scores. However, linguistic features related to cohesion affect and lexical proficiency explained approximately 30% of the variance (R2 = .303) in the math scores.","Rakesh Agrawal,Rakesh Agrawal,Rakesh Agrawal,Rakesh Agrawal,Ramakrishnan Srikant",,2017

This study aims to develop a mammography-based radiomics nomogram for the preoperative prediction of ALN metastasis in patients with breast cancer. This study enrolled 147 patients with clinicopathologically confirmed breast cancer and preoperative mammography. Features were extracted from each patient’s mammography images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression method was used to select features and build a signature in the primary cohort. The performance of the signature was assessed using support vector machines. We developed a nomogram by incorporating the signature with the clinicopathologic risk factors. The nomogram performance was estimated by its calibration ability in the primary and validation cohorts. The signature was consisted of 10 selected ALN-status-related features. The AUC of the signature from the primary cohort was 0.895 (95% CI, 0.887–0.909) and 0.875 (95% CI, 0.698–0.891) for the validation cohort.

We have applied methods of statistical analyses and data mining (Principal Component Analysis and Maximal Spanning Tree) for anonymized students' scores at Faculty of Physics, Warsaw University of Technology. A slight negative linear correlation exists between mean and variance of course grades, i.e. courses with higher mean scores tend to possess a lower scores variance. 
There are courses playing a central role, e.g. their scores are highly correlated to other scores and they are in the centre of corresponding Maximal Spanning Trees. Other courses contribute significantly to students' score variance as well to the first principal component and they are responsible for differentiation of students' scores. Correlations of the first principal component to courses' mean scores and scores variance suggest that this component can be used for assigning ECTS points to a given course.

National statistics indicate that most higher education institutions have four-year degree completion rates around 50%, or just half of their student populations. While there are prediction models which illuminate what factors assist with college student success, interventions that support course selections on a semester-to-semester basis have yet to be deeply understood. To further this goal, we develop a system to predict students' grades in the courses they will enroll in during the next enrollment term by learning patterns from historical transcript data coupled with additional information about students, courses and the instructors teaching them.  We explore a variety of classic and state-of-the-art techniques which have proven effective for recommendation tasks in the e-commerce domain. In our experiments, Factorization Machines (FM), Random Forests (RF), and the Personalized Multi-Linear Regression model achieve the lowest prediction error. Application of a novel feature selection technique is key to the predictive success and interpretability of the FM. By comparing feature importance across populations and across models, we uncover strong connections between instructor characteristics and student performance. We also discover key differences between transfer and non-transfer students. Ultimately we find that a hybrid FM-RF method can be used to accurately predict grades for both new and returning students taking both new and existing courses. Application of these techniques holds promise for student degree planning, instructor interventions, and personalized advising, all of which could improve retention and academic performance.",Reinhard Pekrun,,2016

Around the world, people desire romantic partners who are intelligent, healthy, kind, physically attractive, wealthy, and more. In order for these ideal preferences to guide the choice of actual romantic partners, human mating psychology must possess a means to integrate information across these many preference dimensions into summaries of the overall mate value of their potential mates. Here we explore the computational design of this mate preference integration process using a large sample of n=14,487 people from 45 countries around the world. We combine this large cross-cultural sample with agent-based models to compare eight hypothesized models of human mating markets. Across cultures, people higher in mate value appear to experience greater power of choice on the mating market in that they set higher ideal standards, better fulfill their preferences in choice, and pair with higher mate value partners. Furthermore, we find that this cross-culturally universal pattern of mate choice is most consistent with a Euclidean model of mate preference integration.","Ricardo Caceffo,Pablo Frank-Bolton,Renan Souza,Rodolfo Azevedo,Rodolfo Azevedo",Scientific Reports,2019

By comparison, compound 1 had the best selectivity and compound 5 had the strongest binding ability among the five compounds. And compound 5 had the highest sensitivity to H2PO4− among the measured anions, and it also can be applied to actual samples, the content of H2PO4− tested in the potassium dihydrogen phosphate fertilizer solution reached above 97.5% of the marked content, and the recovery rates were within the range of 98.5–99.1%, attesting that this method was reliable for the test of H2PO4− in fertilizer. Through HRMS titration, circular dichroism and optical rotation experiments, the probable interacted mechanism was proved that the interaction site was the C=C of the α,β-unsaturated ketone structure. In addition, the interacted mechanism was researched from the perspective of chirality. Furthermore, theoretical investigation analysis was introduced to reveal that the roles of molecular frontier orbitals in molecular interplay were determined.

,,,Predicting Student Performance in Interactive Online Question Pools Using Mouse Interaction Features,"Modeling student learning and further predicting the performance is a well-established task in online learning and is crucial to personalized education by recommending different learning resources to different students based on their needs. Interactive online question pools (e.g., educational game platforms), an important component of online education, have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, most existing work on student performance prediction targets at online learning platforms with a well-structured curriculum, predefined question order and accurate knowledge tags provided by domain experts. It remains unclear how to conduct student performance prediction in interactive online question pools without such well-organized question orders or knowledge tags by experts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to boost student performance prediction in interactive online question pools by further considering student interaction features and the similarity between questions. Specifically, we introduce new features (e.g., think time, first attempt, and first drag-and-drop) based on student mouse movement trajectories to delineate students' problem-solving details.

10.3390/electronics9020219,,,A Novel PCA-Firefly Based XGBoost Classification Model for Intrusion Detection in Networks Using GPU,"The enormous popularity of the internet across all spheres of human life has introduced various risks of malicious attacks in the network. The activities performed over the network could be effortlessly proliferated, which has led to the emergence of intrusion detection systems. The patterns of the attacks are also dynamic, which necessitates efficient classification and prediction of cyber attacks. In this paper we propose a hybrid principal component analysis (PCA)-firefly based machine learning model to classify intrusion detection system (IDS) datasets. The dataset used in the study is collected from Kaggle. The model first performs One-Hot encoding for the transformation of the IDS datasets. The hybrid PCA-firefly algorithm is then used for dimensionality reduction. The XGBoost algorithm is implemented on the reduced dataset for classification. A comprehensive evaluation of the model is conducted with the state of the art machine learning approaches to justify the superiority of our proposed approach. The experimental results confirm the fact that the proposed model performs better than the existing machine learning models.","Richard D. De Veaux,Mahesh Agarwal,Maia Averett,Benjamin S.

10.1145/3375462.3375474,,,Supporting actionable intelligence: reframing the analysis of observed study strategies,"Models and processes developed in learning analytics research are increasing in sophistication and predictive power. However, the ability to translate analytic findings to practice remains problematic. This study aims to address this issue by establishing a model of learner behaviour that is both predictive of student course performance, and easily interpreted by instructors. To achieve this aim, we analysed fine grained trace data (from 3 offerings of an undergraduate online course, N=1068) to establish a comprehensive set of behaviour indicators aligned with the course design. The identified behaviour patterns, which we refer to as observed study strategies, proved to be associated with the student course performance. By examining the observed strategies of high and low performers throughout the course, we identified prototypical pathways associated with course success and failure. The proposed model and approach offers valuable insights for the provision of process-oriented feedback early in the course, and thus can aid learners in developing their capacity to succeed online.","Robert J.

10.1145/3375462.3375498,,,Predicting learners' effortful behaviour in adaptive assessment using multimodal data,"Many factors influence learners' performance on an activity beyond the knowledge required. Learners' on-task effort has been acknowledged for strongly relating to their educational outcomes, reflecting how actively they are engaged in that activity. However, effort is not directly observable. Multimodal data can provide additional insights into the learning processes and may allow for effort estimation. This paper presents an approach for the classification of effort in an adaptive assessment context. Specifically, the behaviour of 32 students was captured during an adaptive self-assessment activity, using logs and physiological data (i.e., eye-tracking, EEG, wristband and facial expressions). We applied k-means to the multimodal data to cluster students' behavioural patterns. Next, we predicted students' effort to complete the upcoming task, based on the discovered behavioural patterns using a combination of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and the Viterbi algorithm. We also compared the results with other state-of-the-art classification algorithms (SVM, Random Forest). Our findings provide evidence that HMMs can encode the relationship between effort and behaviour (captured by the multimodal data) in a more efficient way than the other methods. Foremost, a practical implication of the approach is that the derived HMMs also pinpoint the moments to provide preventive/prescriptive feedback to the learners in real-time, by building-upon the relationship between behavioural patterns and the effort the learners are putting in.","Robert K.

10.1016/j.imu.2020.100330,,,Classification models for heart disease prediction using feature selection and PCA,"Abstract   The prediction of cardiac disease helps practitioners make more accurate decisions regarding patients' health. Therefore, the use of machine learning (ML) is a solution to reduce and understand the symptoms related to heart disease. The aim of this work is the proposal of a dimensionality reduction method and finding features of heart disease by applying a feature selection technique. The information used for this analysis was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository called Heart Disease. The dataset contains 74 features and a label that we validated by six ML classifiers. Chi-square and principal component analysis (CHI-PCA) with random forests (RF) had the highest accuracy, with 98.7% for Cleveland, 99.0% for Hungarian, and 99.4% for Cleveland-Hungarian (CH) datasets. From the analysis, ChiSqSelector derived features of anatomical and physiological relevance, such as cholesterol, highest heart rate, chest pain, features related to ST depression, and heart vessels. The experimental results proved that the combination of chi-square with PCA obtains greater performance in most classifiers. The usage of PCA directly from the raw data computed lower results and would require greater dimensionality to improve the results.","Roger Azevedo,Dragan Gasevic",Informatics in Medicine Unlocked,2020

Furthermore, the automation part of EDM is closer to the concept of artificial intelligence. Due to the wide applications of artificial intelligence in assorted fields, the authors are curious about the state-of-art of related applications in Education.,This study focused on systematically reviewing 1,219 EDM studies that were searched from five digital databases based on a strict search procedure. Although 33 reviews were attempted to synthesize research literature, several research gaps were identified. A comprehensive and systematic review report is needed to show us: what research trends can be revealed and what major research topics and open issues are existed in EDM research.,Results show that the EDM research has moved toward the early majority stage; EDM publications are mainly contributed by “actual analysis” category; machine learning or even deep learning algorithms have been widely adopted, but collecting actual larger data sets for EDM research is rare, especially in K-12. Four major research topics, including prediction of performance, decision support for teachers and learners, detection of behaviors and learner modeling and comparison or optimization of algorithms, have been identified. Some open issues and future research directions in EDM field are also put forward.,Limitations for this search method include the likelihood of missing EDM research that was not captured through these portals.,This systematic review has not only reported the research trends of EDM but also discussed open issues to direct future research. Finally, it is concluded that the state-of-art of EDM research is far from the ideal of artificial intelligence and the automatic support part for teaching and learning in EDM may need improvement in the future work.","Rong Tang,Rong Tang,Watinee Sae-Lim",,2020

We analyze here the cross-correlations of price changes of different cryptocurrencies using Random Matrix Theory and extract community structures by constructing minimum spanning trees, finding their eigenvalues contrast sharply with universal predictions of Random Matrix Theory. We reveal distinct transient community structures among different groupings of cryptocurrencies. By studying the cross-correlation dynamics of sub-communities we find evidence of collective behaviour. Furthermore, we compare eigenvalue changes and find prominent groupings following a community trend, useful for creating cryptocurrency portfolios.","Ronny Scherer,Fazilat Siddiq,Bárbara Sánchez Viveros",Journal of Computational Science,2020

We introduce several RMT methods and analytical techniques, such as the Replica formalism and Free Probability, with an emphasis on the Marchenko-Pastur equation that provides information on the resolvent of multiplicatively corrupted noisy matrices. Special care is devoted to the statistics of the eigenvectors of the empirical correlation matrix, which turn out to be crucial for many applications. We show in particular how these results can be used to build consistent ""Rotationally Invariant"" estimators (RIE) for large correlation matrices when there is no prior on the structure of the underlying process. The last part of this review is dedicated to some real-world applications within financial markets as a case in point. We establish empirically the efficacy of the RIE framework, which is found to be superior in this case to all previously proposed methods. The case of additively (rather than multiplicatively) corrupted noisy matrices is also dealt with in a special Appendix. Several open problems and interesting technical developments are discussed throughout the paper.",Ruey-Shiang Shaw,Physics Reports,2017
10.1016/j.chb.2020.106674,,,Assessing program-level learning strategies in MOOCs,"Abstract   Massive Open Online Courses have provided researchers with considerable opportunities to assess student learning within technically mediated online environments. However, for most reported studies, analyses are conducted from a single MOOC or over multiple MOOCs with different learner enrolments. Thus, this limits the opportunities to assess the changing behavior of learners over time. In this paper, the behavioral engagement of 175 students was examined, who were enrolled in a professional development study program consisting of four different MOOCs, comprising a complete program of study. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to understand the changing behavior of learners within each course and across the MOOC program. To do this, we used latent class analysis, a clustering technique widely used in other fields, but mostly unexplored within educational technology research. Our results revealed six weekly learning strategies based on student course engagement and three different program-level learning strategies, which not only differed in their learning behavior but also their final academic outcomes. Our study also showed substantial effects of MOOC course design on the level of student engagement in the courses. The results and implications are further discussed.","Rui Ting Wu,Y Tu,Quynh Lê,Bronwyn Reynolds",Computers in Human Behavior,2020

We develop an early detection system (EDS) using administrative student data from a state and a private university to predict student success as a basis for a targeted intervention. The EDS uses regression analysis, neural networks, decision trees, and the AdaBoost algorithm to identify student characteristics which distinguish potential dropouts from graduates. Prediction accuracy at the end of the first semester is 79% for the state university and 85% for the private university of applied sciences.

Methods: The correlation coefficient was used to quantify the intensity of the correlation between courses, and a visualisation complex network of the dental curriculum was built to explore the curriculum pattern from a dynamic perspective. Further, the statistical measurements of curriculum network were adopted to express the most relevant topological features. Subsequently, the minimum spanning tree and parallel coordinates plot were drawn to explore the curriculum community structure, quantify the key courses, and present different courses in time and space relationships. Results: The correlation analysis results show that the courses are closely related to each other. The main courses focus on pathology, pathophysiology, oral anatomy and physiology, closely connecting almost all medicine-related courses. The whole course network has an average degree value of 41.53, and a clustering coefficient of 0.78, indicating an obvious small-world characteristic. From the perspective of curriculum attributes, the number of public and theoretical courses was more than that of skills and practical courses. Moreover, the academic performance of skills and practical courses was lower than that of public and theoretical courses. Conclusion: The undergraduate dental courses have a progressive structure from basic professional knowledge to professional skills, which is reasonable for the dental education in China. However, some efforts towards curriculum reform based on this study are needed.","Ryan S. Baker,Paul Salvador Inventado",Journal of Computational Chemistry,2021
,,,Students’ Behaviours in using Learning Resources in Higher Education: How do behaviours reflect success in Programming Education?,"Programming education traditionally has been an important part of Information Technology-related degrees but, more recently, it is also becoming essential in many STEM domains as well. Despite this, drop-out rates in programming courses in higher education institutions are considerable and cannot be ignored. At the same time, analysing learning behaviours has been reported to be an effective way to support the improvement of teaching and learning quality. This article aims to deliver an in-depth analysis of students’ learning behaviours when using course material items. We analyse an introductory programming course at a University in Dublin. The dataset is extracted from automatically logged learning data from a bespoke online learning system. The analysis makes use of the power of Principal Component Analysis and Random Matrix Theory to reduce dimensionality in, and to extract information from, the data, verifying the results with rigorous statistical tests. Overall, we found that all the students follow a common learning pattern in accessing all given learning items. However, there is a noticeable difference between higher and lower-performing cohorts of students when using practical and theoretical learning items. The high performing students have been consistently active in practice during the study progress. On the other hand, the students who failed the exam have more recorded activities in reading lecture notes and appear to become discouraged and unmotivated from the practical activities, especially in the later stage of the semester.","S.

10.1007/978-3-540-89208-3_324,,,Influence of Mental Stress on Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability,"Stress is a huge problem in today’s society. Being able to measure stress, therefore, may help to address this problem. Although stress has a psychological origin, it affects several physiological processes in the human body: increased muscle tension in the neck, change in concentration of several hormones and a change in heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV). The brain innervates the heart by means of stimuli via the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), which is divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic branches. The sympathetic activity leads to an increase in HR (e.g. during sports exercise), while parasympathetic activity induces a lower HR (e.g. during sleep). The two circuits are constantly interacting and this interaction is reflected in HRV. HRV, therefore, provides a measure to express the activity of the ANS, and may consequently provide a measure for stress. We therefore explored measures of HR and HRV with an imposed stressful situation. We recorded changes in HR and HRV in a group of 28 subjects at rest, and with a mental stressor. The results suggest that HR and HRV change with a mental task. HR and HRV recordings may have the potential, therefore, to measure stress levels and guide preventive measures to reduce stress related illnesses.","Sagar Parihar,Ziyaan Dadachanji,Praveen Kumar Singh,Rajdeep Das,Amey Karkare,Arnab Bhattacharya",,2009
10.1111/bjet.12226,,,Learning with serious games: Is fun playing the game a predictor of learning success?,"Serious games are generally considered to induce positive effects in the areas of learning motivation and learning gains. Yet few studies have examined how these factors are related. Therefore, an empirical study was conducted to test the relationship between anticipated enjoyment and willingness to play, as well as between game enjoyment, self-reported cognitive and motivational learning gains and test results. In an explorative study, 74 children from five primary schools played the learning game AWWWARE. The results of pre- and post-tests were analysed using multiple linear regressions. The analysis showed that anticipated enjoyment played only a minor part in students' willingness to learn with serious games. Of greater importance was the students' expectation that the learning game would be easy and instructive. The level of actual enjoyment of the game also had a smaller influence than expected. While there was a correlation between enjoyment and the motivation to continue being engaged with the subject matter of the game, no effect was found with respect to self-assessed or tested learning gains. The results lead to the conclusion that other factors, such as explicit learning tasks, instruction and support inherent in the game or supplemented by teachers, may be more decisive than the experience of fun during the game.

10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.07.696,,,The Impact of Fun and Enjoyment on Adult's Learning,"Abstract   An exploration of the literature has shown that fun and enjoyment are often discussed in relation to the learning of children and older adults and are rarely mentioned in relation to the learning of adults. This paper explores the role that fun and enjoyment plays in adult learning programs and the impact that this has on an adults learning. The focus is on data gathered in 2012 from interviews with adult learners and their teachers in Victoria, Australia. These conversations found that both groups could identify the fun and enjoyment in their adult learning experience. The findings have been analysed firstly as an overall experience, with adult learners talking more freely about fun and enjoyment and teachers talking about engagement, social relationships and safety. Learners identified a number of elements that are part of their experience of fun and enjoyment: the activities they undertake, the process established by the teachers, interacting with others, humour, achievement, their emotions and well-being and personal benefits. Both adult learners and their teachers also believed that fun and enjoyment impacted on adults learning and they were able to articulate the role that fun and enjoyment plays in adult learning programs. Firstly both having fun and experiencing enjoyment were perceived by both learners and teachers as a motivator to attend classes and learn the knowledge and skills. Secondly fun and enjoyment were considered a mechanism that encouraged concentration by learners and helped in the absorption of learning. Finally having fun and experiencing enjoyment were identified as a proven way to build a socially connected learning environment. The research indicates that a greater focus on the affective domain of adults learning experience, in particular fun and enjoyment could prove to be as beneficial and important as it is currently considered in children's learning. A different approach to the design of adult learning experiences and methods that incorporates greater use of fun may mean that more adults are encouraged and motivated to participate in learning with enthusiasm for the journey and optimism for the outcomes.","Scott A.

The participants asked questions when given the breakdown scenario, and an eyetracker recorded their fixations. As was predicted, deep comprehenders asked better questions and fixated on device components that explained the malfunction.

Here we propose a unifying theory, which states that stress will only facilitate learning and memory processes: (i) when stress is experienced in the context and around the time of the event that needs to be remembered, and (ii) when the hormones and transmitters released in response to stress exert their actions on the same circuits as those activated by the situation, that is, when convergence in time and space takes place. The mechanism of action of stress hormones, particularly corticosteroids, can explain how stress within the context of a learning experience induces focused attention and improves memory of relevant information.","Sebastian Gross,Sebastian Gross,Benjamin Paaßen,Bassam Mokbel,Benjamin Paassen,Barbara Hammer,Niels Pinkwart",Trends in Cognitive Sciences,2006
10.1016/j.learninstruc.2011.10.001,,,Dynamics of affective states during complex learning,"Abstract   We propose a model to explain the dynamics of affective states that emerge during deep learning activities. The model predicts that learners in a state of engagement/flow will experience cognitive disequilibrium and confusion when they face contradictions, incongruities, anomalies, obstacles to goals, and other impasses. Learners revert into the engaged/flow state if equilibrium is restored through thought, reflection, and problem solving. However, failure to restore equilibrium as well as obstacles that block goals trigger frustration, which, if unresolved, will eventually lead to boredom. The major hypotheses of the model were supported in two studies in which participants completed a 32–35min tutoring session with a computer tutor. Their affective states were tracked at approximately 110 points in their tutoring sessions via a retrospective affect judgment protocol. Time series analyses confirmed the presence of confusion–engagement/flow, boredom–frustration, and confusion–frustration oscillations. We discuss enhancements of the model to address individual differences and pedagogical and motivational strategies that are inspired by the model.","Sebastian Proksch,Sven Amann,Sarah Nadi",Learning and Instruction,2012

Nowadays, many children use the game-based learning materials for leaning. However, the difficulty and frustration of the materials usually decrease learners' pleasure and interests. Learners' facial emotions intuitionally respond to their learning condition. Accordingly, the aim of the study is developing the affective interface of the game-based adaptive learning to enhance children's learning motivation. The various difficulty levels of a puzzle game and learning contents are designed to adapt in accordance to the learner's facial emotion which is recognized and classified by Ekam's FACS. Three groups of the elementary school students are recruited to separately participate in the evaluation experiments. One group is for the adaptive game, another for the adaptive learning content, and the other one is the control group for no adaptive learning. Afterword the subjects use the affective usability scale to evaluate the system. The results reveal the game-based learning system could enhance learners' learning motivation and satisfaction. Conclude that the affective interface developed by facial affective computing is proposed to apply on the adaptive learning.","Serena Lee-Cultura,Kshitij Sharma,Michail N. Giannakos",,2012

The theory provides an integrative framework for analyzing the antecedents and effects of emotions experienced in achievement and academic settings. It is based on the premise that appraisals of control and values are central to the arousal of achievement emotions, including activity-related emotions such as enjoyment, frustration, and boredom experienced at learning, as well as outcome emotions such as joy, hope, pride, anxiety, hopelessness, shame, and anger relating to success or failure. Corollaries of the theory pertain to the multiplicity and domain specificity of achievement emotions; to their more distal individual and social antecedents, their effects on engagement and achievement, and the reciprocal linkages between emotions, antecedents and effects; to the regulation and development of these emotions; and to their relative universality across genders and cultures. Implications addressed concern the conceptual integration of emotion, motivation, and cognition, and the need to advance mixed-method paradigms.

To date most of the work on learning analytics and educational data mining has been focused on online courses and cognitive tutors, both of which provide a high degree of structure to the tasks, and are restricted to interactions that occur in front of a computer screen. In this paper, we argue that multimodal learning analytics can offer new insights into students’ learning trajectories in more complex and open-ended learning environments. We present several examples of this work and its educational application.",Shlomo Sharan,Journal of learning Analytics,2016
10.18608/jla.2016.32.14,,,Using Multimodal Learning Analytics to Model Student Behavior: A Systematic Analysis of Epistemological Framing,"Research has shown that students respond to social expectations of interviews by engaging with the content in distinct ways that may or may not be productive. These structures of expectations with respect to knowledge are referred to as epistemological framing. In this study our goal is to introduce a systematic way to analyze student behaviors and describe how they cluster together to reflect different epistemological frames. In analyzing the data statistically, frames are regarded as a latent variable that accounts for the co-occurrence of behaviors. We use a computer clustering algorithm to systematically identify behavioral clusters in videotaped data of early elementary students that construct explanations of biological systems in semi-structured interviews. We also examine the relationship between these behavioral clusters and mechanistic reasoning as a way to investigate the importance of the inferences made based on these identified frames. Results show that there is a clear association between epistemological framing and student reasoning. By providing a statistical model of student framing, our approach can support the ongoing refinement of theory around epistemological frames and their impact on learning.","Shuchi Grover,Ari Korhonen",Journal of learning Analytics,2016
10.1145/3012430.3012602,,,Assessing engagement in an emotionally-adaptive applied game,"In recent years, the interest to the area of computer games for educational purposes increased due to their positive outcomes and effects in technology-enhanced learning. One of their chief merits is retaining the learning motivation and engagement of players during all time of the game. Therefore, it is necessary educational games to be able to adjust their features such as task difficulty, object speed, learning content, etc. according to the current emotional state of the player and, as well, to his/her playing style. In this paper, we present a dynamic mechanism for affective game adaptation based on both emotion and arousal estimation. The mechanism is implemented within an applied video game named ""Rush for Gold"" designed for implicit recognition of playing or learning styles. The paper outlines, analyzes and discusses results of an experimental study related to player's engagement in affective applied adaptation.","Shuchi Grover,Satabdi Basu",,2016
10.1145/3078072.3079740,,,Using Eye-Tracking to Unveil Differences Between Kids and Teens in Coding Activities,"Computational thinking and coding is gradually becoming an important part of K-12 education. Most parents, policy makers, teachers, and industrial stakeholders want their children to attain computational thinking and coding competences, since learning how to code is emerging as an important skill for the 21st century. Currently, educators are leveraging a variety of technological tools and programming environments, which can provide challenging and dynamic coding experiences. Despite the growing research on the design of coding experiences for children, it is still difficult to say how children of different ages learn to code, and to cite differences in their task-based behaviour. This study uses eye-tracking data from 44 children (here divided into ""kids"" [age 8-12] and ""teens"" [age 13-17]) to understand the learning process of coding in a deeper way, and the role of gaze in the learning gain and the different age groups. The results show that kids are more interested in the appearance of the characters, while teens exhibit more hypothesis-testing behaviour in relation to the code. In terms of collaboration, teens spent more time overall performing the task than did kids (higher similarity gaze). Our results suggest that eye-tracking data can successfully reveal how children of different ages learn to code.","Shuchi Grover,Satabdi Basu,Marie Bienkowski,Michael Eagle,Nicholas Diana,John C.

10.1007/s40593-017-0160-1,,,A Multimodal Analysis of Making,"This paper presents three multimodal learning analytic approaches from a hands-on learning activity. We use video, audio, gesture and bio-physiology data from a two-condition study (N=20), to identify correlations between the multimodal data, experimental condition, and two learning outcomes: design quality and learning. The three approaches incorporate: 1) human-annotated coding of video data, 2) automated coding of gesture, audio and bio-physiological data and, 3) concatenated human-annotated and automatically annotated data. Within each analysis we employ the same machine learning and sequence mining techniques. Ultimately we find that each approach provides different affordances depending on the similarity metric and the dependent variable. For example, the analysis based on human-annotated data found strong correlations among multimodal behaviors, experimental condition, success and learning, when we relaxed constraints on temporal similarity. The second approach performed well when comparing students’ multimodal behaviors as a time series, but was less effective using the temporally relaxed similarity metric. The take-away is that there are several strategies for doing multimodal learning analytics, and that many of these approaches can provide a meaningful glimpse into a complex data set, glimpses that may be difficult to identify using traditional approaches.","Shyam R.

Sensing technologies can generate large amounts of fine-grained data automatically captured from student movements. Researchers can use these fine-grained data to create a high-resolution picture of the activity that takes place during these student–computer interactions and explore whether the sequence of movements has an effect on learning. We present a use-case modelling of temporal data in an interactive learning environment with hand gestures, and discuss some validity threats if temporal dependencies are not accounted for. In particular, we assess how, if ignored, the temporal dependencies in the measurement of hand gestures might affect the goodness of fit of the statistical model and would affect the measurement of the similarity between elicited and enacted movement. Our findings show that accounting for temporality is crucial for finding a meaningful fit to the data. In using temporal analytics, we are able to create a high-resolution picture of how sensorimotor coordination correlates with learning gains in our learning system.","Sidney K. D'Mello,Arthur C.

10.1016/j.ijcci.2018.01.004,,,How do you feel about learning to code? Investigating the effect of children’s attitudes towards coding using eye-tracking,"Abstract   Computational thinking and coding for children are attracting increasing attention. There are several efforts around the globe to implement coding frameworks for children, and there is a need to develop an empirical knowledge base of methods and tools. One major problem for integrating study results into a common body of knowledge is the relatively limited measurements applied, and the relation of the widely used self-reporting methods with more objective measurements, such as biophysical ones. In this study, eye-tracking activity was used to measure children’s learning and activity indicators. The goal of the study is to utilize eye-tracking to understand children’s activity while they learn how to code and to investigate any potential association between children’s attitudes and their gaze. In this contribution, we designed an experiment with 44 children (between 8 and 17 years old) who participated in a full-day construction-based coding activity. We recorded their gaze while they were working and captured their attitudes in relation to their learning, excitement and intention. The results showed a significant relation between children’s attitudes (what they think about coding) and their gaze patterns (how they behaved during coding). Eye-tracking data provide initial insights into the behaviour of children, for example if children have difficulty in extracting information or fail to accomplish an expected task. Therefore, further studies need to be conducted to shed additional light on children’s experience and learning duringcoding.","Simon,Andrew Luxton-Reilly,Andrew Luxton-Reilly,Vangel V.

In this work, children’s activity using motion-based technology is framed as an example of embodied learning. The present investigation focuses on the use of a series of Kinect-based educational games by 31 elementary students with special educational needs in mainstream schools, during a five-month intervention study. Results based on psychometric pre-post testing in conjunction with games-usage analytics, a student attitudinal scale, teachers’ reflection notes and teacher interviews, demonstrated the positive impact of the games on children’s short-term memory skills and emotional stage. Overall, the study improves our understanding of embodied learning via motion-based technology in teaching and learning with children with special educational needs.","Skipper Seabold,Josef Perktold,Josef Perktold",Techtrends,2018
10.1016/j.compedu.2018.06.031,,,Virtual learning environment engagement and learning outcomes at a ‘bricks-and-mortar’ university,"Abstract   In this study, we analyse the relationship between engagement in a virtual learning environment (VLE) and module grades at a ‘bricks-and-mortar’ university in the United Kingdom. We measure VLE activity for students enrolled in 38 different credit-bearing modules, each of which are compulsory components of six degree programmes. Overall we find that high VLE activity is associated with high grades, but low activity does not necessarily imply low grades. Analysis of individual modules shows a wide range of relationships between the two quantities. Grouping module-level relationships by programme suggests that science-based subjects have a higher dependency on VLE activity. Considering learning design (LD), we find that VLE usage is more important in modules that adopt an instruction-based learning style. We also test the predictive power of VLE usage in determining grades, again finding variation between degree programmes and potential for predicting a student's final grade weeks in advance of assessment. Our findings suggest that student engagement with learning at a bricks-and-mortar university is in general hard to determine by VLE usage alone, due to the predominance of other “offline” learning activities, but that VLE usage can nonetheless help to predict performance for some disciplines.","Slava Kalyuga,Alexander Renkl,Fred Paas",Computers in Education,2018
10.1145/3264913,,,Unobtrusive Assessment of Students' Emotional Engagement during Lectures Using Electrodermal Activity Sensors,"Modern wearable devices enable the continuous and unobtrusive monitoring of human physiological parameters, including heart rate and electrodermal activity. Through the definition of adequate models these parameters allow to infer the wellbeing, empathy, or engagement of humans in different contexts. In this paper, we show that off-the-shelf wearable devices can be used to unobtrusively monitor the emotional engagement of students during lectures. We propose the use of several novel features to capture students' momentary engagement and use existing methods to characterize the general arousal of students and their physiological synchrony with the teacher. To evaluate our method we collect a data set that -- after data cleaning -- contains data from 24 students, 9 teachers, and 41 lectures. Our results show that non-engaged students can be identified with high reliability. Using a Support Vector Machine, for instance, we achieve a recall of 81% -- which is a 25 percentage points improvement with respect to a Biased Random classifier. Overall, our findings may inform the design of systems that allow students to self-monitor their engagement and act upon the obtained feedback. Teachers could profit of information about non-engaged students too to perform self-reflection and to devise and evaluate methods to (re-)engage students.","Sofia Papavlasopoulou,Kshitij Sharma,Michail N.

The results supported a model which showed that students’ perceptions of the learning environment and prior academic achievement had direct effects on learning outcomes, and indirect effects via their engagement. The effects, however, varied depending on the type of the outcome in question: (1) Student engagement mediated the relationship between course experience and generic skills development, (2) cocurricular experience positively predicted learning satisfaction, (3) first semester GPA positively predicted cumulative university GPA, and (4) National College Entrance Examination scores did not correlate with any other factor. A major proportion of the variance in the three types of learning outcomes was accounted for by the model, showing its effectiveness in predicting university students’ learning.

Based on control-value theory (Pekrun, 2006), we reviewed 186 studies examining emotions in TBLEs that were published between 1965 and 2018. We extracted effect sizes quantifying relations between emotions (enjoyment, curiosity/interest, anxiety, anger/frustration, confusion, boredom) and their antecedents (control-value appraisals, prior knowledge, gender, TBLE characteristics) and outcomes (engagement, learning strategies, achievement). Mean effects largely supported hypotheses (e.g., positive relations between enjoyment and appraisals, achievement, and cognitive support) and remained relatively stable across moderators. These findings imply that levels of emotions differ across TBLEs, but that their functional relations with appraisals and learning are equivalent across environments. Implications for research and designing emotionally sound TBLEs are discussed.","Sofia Papavlasopoulou,Michail N. Giannakos,Letizia Jaccheri",Learning and Instruction,2018
10.1016/j.chb.2019.01.008,,,Exploring children's learning experience in constructionism-based coding activities through design-based research,"Abstract   Over the last few years, the integration of coding activities for children in K-12 education has flourished. In addition, novel technological tools and programming environments have offered new opportunities and increased the need to design effective learning experiences. This paper presents a design-based research (DBR) approach conducted over two years, based on constructionism-based coding experiences for children, following the four stages of DBR. Three iterations (cycles) were designed and examined in total, with participants aged 8–17 years old, using mixed methods. Over the two years, we conducted workshops in which students used a block-based programming environment (i.e., Scratch) and collaboratively created a socially meaningful artifact (i.e., a game). The study identifies nine design principles that can help us to achieve higher engagement during the coding activity. Moreover, positive attitudes and high motivation were found to result in the better management of cognitive load. Our contribution lies in the theoretical grounding of the results in constructionism and the emerging design principles. In this way, we provide both theoretical and practical evidence of the value of constructionism-based coding activities.","Sofia Papavlasopoulou,Michail N.

10.1177/1529100619832930,31313636,,Emotional Expressions Reconsidered: Challenges to Inferring Emotion From Human Facial Movements:,"It is commonly assumed that a person’s emotional state can be readily inferred from his or her facial movements, typically called emotional expressions or facial expressions. This assumption influences legal judgments, policy decisions, national security protocols, and educational practices; guides the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness, as well as the development of commercial applications; and pervades everyday social interactions as well as research in other scientific fields such as artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and computer vision. In this article, we survey examples of this widespread assumption, which we refer to as the common view, and we then examine the scientific evidence that tests this view, focusing on the six most popular emotion categories used by consumers of emotion research: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The available scientific evidence suggests that people do sometimes smile when happy, frown when sad, scowl when angry, and so on, as proposed by the common view, more than what would be expected by chance. Yet how people communicate anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise varies substantially across cultures, situations, and even across people within a single situation. Furthermore, similar configurations of facial movements variably express instances of more than one emotion category. In fact, a given configuration of facial movements, such as a scowl, often communicates something other than an emotional state. Scientists agree that facial movements convey a range of information and are important for social communication, emotional or otherwise. But our review suggests an urgent need for research that examines how people actually move their faces to express emotions and other social information in the variety of contexts that make up everyday life, as well as careful study of the mechanisms by which people perceive instances of emotion in one another. We make specific research recommendations that will yield a more valid picture of how people move their faces to express emotions and how they infer emotional meaning from facial movements in situations of everyday life.

Arguments about whether AI should be a human replacing technology or a human assisting technology frequently take centre stage. Education is no exception when it comes to questions about the role that AI should play, and as with many other professional areas, the exact role of AI in education is not easy to predict. Here, we argue that one potential role for AI in education is to provide opportunities for human intelligence augmentation, with AI supporting us in decision‐making processes, rather than replacing us through automation. To provide empirical evidence to support our argument, we present a case study in the context of debate tutoring, in which we use prediction and classification models to increase the transparency of the intuitive decision‐making processes of expert tutors for advanced reflections and feedback. Furthermore, we compare the accuracy of unimodal and multimodal classification models of expert human tutors' decisions about the social and emotional aspects of tutoring while evaluating trainees. Our results show that multimodal data leads to more accurate classification models in the context we studied. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",Štefan Pero,British Journal of Educational Technology,2019

The articles identify a number of emotions that frequently occur in digital learning environments across different tasks, goals, populations, and subject matters. The Control Value Theory of achievement emotions unifies the research reported in the articles, whereas social emotions surface in contexts where there are significant social interactions, such as group learning or the training of medical students. The emotions that were detected and tracked in the reported studies rely on self-reports of learners and judges who observe them. This commentary identifies a number of limitations of the studies that will hopefully stimulate future research. Researchers are encouraged to collect (1) larger sample sizes, (2) longer interventions with learning technologies, (3) physiological, multimodal, and behavioral signatures of emotions to complement the subjective judgments, (4) more precise timing and transitions between emotions to uncover emotion dynamics, (5) assessments of nonlinear relations between variables, and (6) interventions designed to regulate and productively respond to learner emotions.",Stephanie Bell,Learning and Instruction,2019

This paper provides an overview of what and how MMD have been used to inform learning and in what contexts. A search resulted in 42 papers that were included in the analysis. The results of the review depict the capabilities of MMD for learning and the ongoing advances and implications that emerge from the employment of MMD to capture and improve learning. In particular, we identified the six main objectives (ie, behavioral trajectories, learning outcome, learning-task performance, teacher support, engagement and student feedback) that the MMLA research has been focusing on. We also summarize the implications derived from the reviewed articles and frame them within six thematic areas. Finally, this review stresses that future research should consider developing a framework that would enable MMD capacities to be aligned with the research and learning design (LD). These MMD capacities could also be utilized on furthering theory and practice. Our findings set a baseline to support the adoption and democratization of MMD within future learning technology research and development.

Accordingly, efforts to evaluate whether students enjoyed a certain learning activity are often an important aspect of innovations. However, the role of fun in learning in the aforementioned fields is not well understood not least due to a lack of a common theoretical framework for defining the concept of fun and for supporting its measurement. This study set out to investigate the role that fun plays in students’ learning to code and its impact on their attitude towards the topic. We designed a two-hour-long playful coding workshop and measured the experienced fun using FunQ, a theoretically motivated and empirically grounded inventory for measuring fun in learning activities. Eighty-six children (N = 86) with ages between 9 and 12 participated in the study. For the analysis, we used structural equation modelling and mediation analysis. Our results support efforts of educational researchers and practitioners who try to make learning activities more fun for students. While fun was not shown to have a direct effect on learning assessed through a self-report measure, it had a significant and positive indirect effect on perceived learning through student’s attitude towards coding. Future research should examine whether this empirical finding extends to learning activities beyond coding and different age groups.","Sweta Bhattacharya,Sweta Bhattacharya,Siva Rama Krishnan S,Siva Rama Krishnan S,Praveen Kumar Reddy Maddikunta,Praveen Kumar Reddy Maddikunta,Rajesh Kaluri,Rajesh Kaluri,Saurabh Singh,Saurabh Singh,Saurabh Singh,Thippa Reddy Gadekallu,Mamoun Alazab,Usman Tariq,Usman Tariq",International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction,2021

Therefore, researchers in the above fields aim to explore how learning activities could be made more enjoyable in order to facilitate engagement in the learning process and to improve the learning outcomes. Despite such wide interest, there has been little systematic effort to define and measure fun. The herein introduced research aims to (a) define the term “fun” and (b) to create a tool for the reliable measurement of it. In the first study testing the initial item pool 75 students (μage=11.78); in the think-aloud study testing the comprehensibility of the items six 11-year-old children and in the final validation study, 128 students (μage=12.15) participated. We applied a deductive scale development approach. For the model testing, CFA was used and second-order latent variable models were fitted. In this paper, we conceptualize the term of fun and introduce the final 18-item version of the FunQ that consists of six dimensions (Autonomy, Challenge, Delight, Immersion, Loss of Social Barriers and Stress) and bears with the appropriate validity and reliability measures (ωoverall=0.875 and ωpartial=0.864; RMSEA=0.052 and SRMR=0.072). We contribute with (a) a review of the literature regarding the concept of fun, (b) a conception of fun as a multidimensional theoretically motivated concept, (c) a multidimensional instrument for assessing experienced fun—the FunQ—and (d) a psychometric evaluation of the proposed instrument.

10.1016/j.ijcci.2021.100355,,,Children’s play and problem-solving in motion-based learning technologies using a multi-modal mixed methods approach,"Abstract   Motion-Based Learning Technologies (MBLT) offer a promising approach for integrating play and problem-solving behaviour within children’s learning. The proliferation of sensor technology has driven the field of learning technology towards the development of tools and methods that may benefit from the produced Multi-Modal Data (MMD). Such data can be used to uncover cognitive, affective and physiological processes during learning activities. Combining MMD with more traditionally exercised assessment tools, such as video content analysis, provides a more holistic understanding of children’s learning experiences and has the potential to enable the design of educational technologies capable of harmonising children’s cognitive, affective and physiological processes, while promoting appropriately balanced play and problem-solving efforts. However, the use of an MMD mixed methods approach that combines qualitative and MMD data to understand children’s behaviours during engagement with MBLT is rather unexplored. We present an in-situ study where 26 children, ages 10–12, solved a motion-based sorting task for learning geometry. We continuously and unobtrusively monitored children’s learning experiences using MMD collection via eye-trackers, wristbands, Kinect joint tracking, and a web camera. We devised SP3, a novel observational scheme that can be used to understand children’s solo interactions with MBLT, and applied it to identify and extract children’s evoked play and problem-solving behaviour.

Lastly, we applied predictive modelling to identify the synergies between various MMD measurements and children’s play and problem-solving behaviours.

However, research into DGBL is not explicit about the role of fun in DGBL. In our study we hypothesized that the perceived fun while playing with an educational game has a positive impact on children’s measured- and perceived learning, motivation, attitude, self-efficacy and intention to play similar games. We conducted an online survey study with secondary school students (N = 28, mean age = 13.54) before and after playing with an online educational game on the topic of biology. The results indicate that the fun they experience while playing the game has a significant and positive effect on the perceived learning, the change in students’ motivation and self-efficacy, and the intention to play similar games. However, no significant effect was found on the measured learning and the change in attitude towards the subject. Our findings partially support the contention that making DGBL more fun improves learning. Future research should seek further empirical evidence in other topic areas and for different ages, and to explore how DGBL can help improve attitudes towards the topic as well.","Tai Tan Mai,Tai Mai,Martin Crane,Marija Bezbradica",,2021

Unfolding the dynamics behind this important synergy can lead to the design of intelligent agents which leverage students' movements and support their learning. However, real-time use of student-generated MMD derived from their interactions with embodied learning systems (MBEG in our case) is challenging and remains under-explored due to its complexity (e.g., handle sensor-data and enable an AI agent to use them). To bridge this gap, we conducted an in-situ study where 40 children, aged 9-12, played MBEG on maths and language development. We automatically, unobtrusively, and continuously monitored students' experiences using eye-tracking glasses, physiological wristbands, and Kinect, during game-play. This allowed us to understand the different cognitive and physiological dimensions of students' progress (right/wrong responses) during the three different stages of the MBEG problem-solving processes, namely the ""see-solve-move-respond"" (S2MR) cycle. We introduce the novel Carry Forward Effect (CFE); a phenomenon occurring in such games, whereby students propagate, or ""carry forward,"" the cognitive and physiological effects derived from their MMD, to subsequent phases in the see-solve-move-respond cycle. By identifying moments when the Carry Forward Effect is congruent (or not) to students' learning performance, we uncover opportunities for feedback delivery to encourage or subdue the impact of the CFE. Our results demonstrate the importance of wristband and eye-tracking data as key indicators for prioritizing adaptive feedback to support students in MBEG and emphasize the significance of using MMD to support students' performance in real-time educational settings.","Tatiana Markova,Irina Glazkova,Elena Zaborova",,2022

In the past, various studies investigated this topic, usually by recording and analysing compiler error messages, and producing tables of relative frequencies of specific errors diagnostics produced by the compiler. In this paper, we improve on such prior studies by investigating actual logical errors in student code, as opposed to diagnostic messages produced by the compiler. The actual errors reported here are more precise, more detailed and more accurate than the diagnostic produced automatically. In order to present frequencies of actual errors, error categories were developed and validated, and student code captured at time of compilation failure was manually analysed by multiple researchers. The results show that error causes can be manually analysed by independent researchers with good reliability. The resulting table of error frequencies shows that prior work using diagnostic messages tended to group some distinct errors together in single categories, which can now be listed more accurately.","Thomas Kluyver,Benjamin Ragan-Kelley,Fernando Perez,Brian E.

More specifically, the current study investigates how students regulate their tool-use throughout the course period by considering the moment tools are used. This temporal dimension has been neglected in current CMS research that considered the course as a single entity when investigating students' tool-use. More insight into students' tool-use is particularly important from an instructional design perspective since research has repeatedly revealed that a learning environment's effectiveness depends heavily on students' adaptive tool-use. Logging students (n = 179) use of multiple CMS tools and registering students' use of the face-to-face support in a blended course, the study reveals that all students regulated their tool-use throughout the course. However, the study demonstrates that only a minority of students regulated one's tool-use in line with the course requirements and this pattern was found to be more adaptive for learning. The results are related to students' awareness regarding the instructional cues and students' perceptions of tool-functionalities. Implications for the instructional design of CMS supported courses are discussed.","Timothy F. Rafalski,P.

10.1145/2839509.2844584,,,An Effective Approach to Enhancing Compiler Error Messages,"One of the many challenges novice programmers face from the time they write their first program is inadequate compiler error messages. These messages report details on errors the programmer has made and are the only feedback the programmer gets from the compiler. For students they play a particularly essential role as students often have little experience to draw upon, leaving compiler error messages as their primary guidance on error correction. However these messages are frequently inadequate, presenting a barrier to progress and are often a source of discouragement. We have designed and implemented an editor that provides enhanced compiler error messages and conducted a controlled empirical study with CS1 students learning Java. We find a reduced frequency of overall errors and errors per student. We also identify eight frequent compiler error messages for which enhancement has a statistically significant effect. Finally we find a reduced number of repeated errors. These findings indicate fewer students struggling with compiler error messages.","Tomas Mikolov,Kai Chen,Kai Chen,Greg S.

However, the potential impact from these techniques is increased when properly contextualized within a learning environment. More studies are needed to explore the connection between student interactions, approaches to learning, and academic performance. Self-regulated learning (SRL) is defined as the extent to which a student is able to motivationally, metacognitively, and cognitively engage in a learning experience. SRL has been the focus of research in traditional classroom learning and is also argued to play a vital role in the online or blended learning contexts. In this paper, we study how SRL affects students' online interactions with various learning activities and its influence in academic performance. The results derived from a naturalistic experiment among a cohort of first year engineering students showed that positive self-regulated strategies (PSRS) and negative self-regulated strategies (NSRS) affected both the interaction with online activities and academic performance. NSRS directly predicted academic outcomes, whereas PSRS only contributed indirectly to academic performance via the interactions with online activities. These results point to concrete avenues to promote self-regulation among students in this type of learning contexts.","Trevor Hastie,Robert Tibshirani,Jerome H. Friedman,Jerome H. Friedman",,2016

,,,"Mindstorms: Children, Computers, And Powerful Ideas","The Gears of My Childhood

Before I was two years old I had developed an intense involvement with automobiles. The names of car parts made up a very substantial portion of my vocabulary: I was particularly proud of knowing about the parts of the transmission system, the gearbox, and most especially the differential. It was, of course, many years later before I understood how gears work; but once I did, playing with gears became a favorite pastime. I loved rotating circular objects against one another in gearlike motions and, naturally, my first ""erector set"" project was a crude gear system.

I became adept at turning wheels in my head and at making chains of cause and effect: ""This one turns this way so that must turn that way so . . . "" I found particular pleasure in such systems as the differential gear, which does not follow a simple linear chain of causality since the motion in the transmission shaft can be distributed in many different ways to the two wheels depending on what resistance they encounter. I remember quite vividly my excitement at discovering that a system could be lawful and completely comprehensible without being rigidly deterministic.

I believe that working with differentials did more for my mathematical development than anything I was taught in elementary school. Gears, serving as models, carried many otherwise abstract ideas into my head. I clearly remember two examples from school math. I saw multiplication tables as gears, and my first brush with equations in two variables (e.g., 3x + 4y = 10) immediately evoked the differential. By the time I had made a mental gear model of the relation between x and y, figuring how many teeth each gear needed, the equation had become a comfortable friend.

Many years later when I read Piaget this incident served me as a model for his notion of assimilation, except I was immediately struck by the fact that his discussion does not do full justice to his own idea. He talks almost entirely about cognitive aspects of assimilation. But there is also an affective component. Assimilating equations to gears certainly is a powerful way to bring old knowledge to bear on a new object. But it does more as well. I am sure that such assimilations helped to endow mathematics, for me, with a positive affective tone that can be traced back to my infantile experiences with cars. I believe Piaget really agrees. As I came to know him personally I understood that his neglect of the affective comes more from a modest sense that little is known about it than from an arrogant sense of its irrelevance. But let me return to my childhood.

One day I was surprised to discover that some adults---even most adults---did not understand or even care about the magic of the gears. I no longer think much about gears, but I have never turned away from the questions that started with that discovery: How could what was so simple for me be incomprehensible to other people? My proud father suggested ""being clever"" as an explanation. But I was painfully aware that some people who could not understand the differential could easily do things I found much more difficult. Slowly I began to formulate what I still consider the fundamental fact about learning: Anything is easy if you can assimilate it to your collection of models. If you can't, anything can be painfully difficult. Here too I was developing a way of thinking that would be resonant with Piaget's. The understanding of learning must be genetic. It must refer to the genesis of knowledge. What an individual can learn, and how he learns it, depends on what models he has available. This raises, recursively, the question of how he learned these models. Thus the ""laws of learning"" must be about how intellectual structures grow out of one another and about how, in the process, they acquire both logical and emotional form.

This book is an exercise in an applied genetic epistemology expanded beyond Piaget's cognitive emphasis to include a concern with the affective. It develops a new perspective for education research focused on creating the conditions under which intellectual models will take root. For the last two decades this is what I have been trying to do. And in doing so I find myself frequently reminded of several aspects of my encounter with the differential gear. First, I remember that no one told me to learn about differential gears. Second, I remember that there was feeling, love, as well as understanding in my relationship with gears. Third, I remember that my first encounter with them was in my second year. If any ""scientific"" educational psychologist had tried to ""measure"" the effects of this encounter, he would probably have failed. It had profound consequences but, I conjecture, only very many years later. A ""pre- and post-"" test at age two would have missed them.

Piaget's work gave me a new framework for looking at the gears of my childhood. The gear can be used to illustrate many powerful ""advanced"" mathematical ideas, such as groups or relative motion. But it does more than this. As well as connecting with the formal knowledge of mathematics, it also connects with the ""body knowledge,"" the sensorimotor schemata of a child. You can be the gear, you can understand how it turns by projecting yourself into its place and turning with it. It is this double relationship---both abstract and sensory---that gives the gear the power to carry powerful mathematics into the mind. In a terminology I shall develop in later chapters, the gear acts here as a transitional object.

A modern-day Montessori might propose, if convinced by my story, to create a gear set for children. Thus every child might have the experience I had. But to hope for this would be to miss the essence of the story. I fell in love with the gears. This is something that cannot be reduced to purely ""cognitive"" terms. Something very personal happened, and one cannot assume that it would be repeated for other children in exactly the same form.

My thesis could be summarized as: What the gears cannot do the computer might. The computer is the Proteus of machines. Its essence is its universality, its power to simulate. Because it can take on a thousand forms and can serve a thousand functions, it can appeal to a thousand tastes. This book is the result of my own attempts over the past decade to turn computers into instruments flexible enough so that many children can each create for themselves something like what the gears were for me.",Viera K.

However, there are reports that indicate that students learning to program in this environment show certain habits that are contrary to the basic programming recommendations. In our work as instructors with high school students, we have detected these and other bad practices, such as the repetition of code and object naming, on a regular basis. This paper focuses on verifying whether these issues can generally be found in the Scratch community, by analyzing a large number of projects available on the Scratch community website. To test this hypothesis, we downloaded 100 projects and analyzed them with two plug-ins we developed to automatically detect these bad practices. The plug-ins extend the functionality of the Hairball tool, a static code analyzer for Scratch projects. The results obtained show that, in general, projects in the repository also incur in the investigated malpractices.

Unfortunately, grading Scratch programs is time-consuming, requiring manual execution of each program. Automation of this process is greatly complicated by the very reason Scratch is an attractive introductory language--the projects are multimedia in nature, requiring eyes and ears to fully appreciate.   We propose Hairball, an automated system that can be used both by a student to point out potential errors or unsafe practices, and by a grader to assist in inspecting the implementation of Scratch programs. Because automatic analysis will not be able to determine the sensory effect, Hairball focuses instead on the implementation, including safe/robust programming practices, providing a ""lint-like"" tool for Scratch.   In this case study, we have created an initial set of Hairball plugins that detect and label instances of initialization of Scratch state, synchronization between say and sound blocks, synchronization between broadcast and receive blocks, and use of timing and loops for complex animation. Our evaluation shows that Hairball is very useful in conjunction with manual analysis. Overall, Hairball was actually slightly more accurate than manual analysis at labeling these instances. Specifically for broadcast/receive, Hairball's analysis correctly classified 99% of the 432 instances, manual analysis only 81%. Overall, if Hairball was only used to identify correctly implemented instances, with manual analysis for the remainder, it would remove 76% of the instances for the manual analysis and assist in the rest, with a false positive rate of less than 0.5%.","Vincent A.

10.1111/j.2517-6161.1995.tb02031.x,,,Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing,"SUMMARY The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.","Vincent D.

10.1109/wcre.1997.624575,,,Evaluation experiments on the detection of programming patterns using software metrics,"Cloning of code fragments in large systems is a common practice that may result in redundant code, higher maintenance costs, and less modular systems. The paper examines and evaluates the use of five data and control flow related metrics for identifying similar code fragments. The metrics are used as signatures for a code fragment. Matching on such signatures results in fast matching that can be used to locate instances of code cloning even in the presence of modifications such as changes in variable names, and insertion of statements. The paper takes an information retrieval approach and reports on experiments conducted for retrieving code fragments in three different software systems.","Vitomir Kovanović,Dragan Gasevic,Maarten de Laat,Srećko Joksimović,Marek Hatala,Olusola Adesope",,1997
10.1109/icpc.2016.7503706,,,Do code smells hamper novice programming? A controlled experiment on Scratch programs,"Recently, block-based programming languages like Alice, Scratch and Blockly have become popular tools for programming education. There is substantial research showing that block-based languages are suitable for early programming education. But can block-based programs be smelly too? And does that matter to learners? In this paper we explore the code smells metaphor in the context of block-based programming language Scratch. We conduct a controlled experiment with 61 novice Scratch programmers, in which we divided the novices into three groups. One third receive a non-smelly program, while the other groups receive a program suffering from the Duplication or the Long Method smell respectively. All subjects then perform the same comprehension tasks on their program, after which we measure their time and correctness. The results of the experiment show that code smell indeed influence performance: subjects working on the program exhibiting code smells perform significantly worse, but the smells did not affect the time subjects needed. Investigating different types of tasks in more detail, we find that Long Method mainly decreases system understanding, while Duplication decreases the ease with which subjects modify Scratch programs.","Wannisa Matcha,Dragan Gasevic,Nora'ayu Ahmad Uzir,Jelena Jovanovic,Abelardo Pardo",,2016

There is substantial research showing that these visual programming environments are suitable for teaching programming concepts. But, what do people do when they use Scratch? In this paper we explore the characteristics of Scratch programs. To this end we have scraped the Scratch public repository and retrieved 250,000 projects. We present an analysis of these projects in three different dimensions. Initially, we look at the types of blocks used and the size of the projects. We then investigate complexity, used abstractions and programming concepts. Finally we detect code smells such as large scripts, dead code and duplicated code blocks. Our results show that 1) most Scratch programs are small, however Scratch programs consisting of over 100 sprites exist, 2) programming abstraction concepts like procedures are not commonly used and 3) Scratch programs do suffer from code smells including large scripts and unmatched broadcast signals.","Wannisa Matcha,Wannisa Matcha,Dragan Gasevic,Nora'ayu Ahmad Uzir,Jelena Jovanovic,Abelardo Pardo,Abelardo Pardo,Lisa Lim,Jorge Maldonado-Mahauad,Sheridan Gentili,Mar Pérez-Sanagustín,Yau Sheng Tsai,Yi-Shan Tsai",,2016

Pipes. In this paper, we explore code smells in block-based end-user programming languages aimed at education. Specifically, we explore the occurrence of smells in two educational languages not previously targeted by smell detection and refactoring research: LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 and Microsoft's Kodu. The results of this exploration show that object-oriented-inspired smells indeed occur in educational end-user languages and are present in 88% and 93% of the EV3 and Kodu programs, respectively. Most commonly we find that programs are plagued with lazy class, duplication, and dead code smells, with duplication smells being present in nearly two-thirds of programs in both languages.","Wen Hua,Zhongyuan Wang,Haixun Wang,Haixun Wang,Kai Zheng,Kai Zheng,Xiaofang Zhou",,2016
10.1145/3017680.3017723,,,"Measuring Student Learning in Introductory Block-Based Programming: Examining Misconceptions of Loops, Variables, and Boolean Logic","Programming in block-based environments is a key element of introductory computer science (CS) curricula in K-12 settings. Past research conducted in the context of text-based programming points to several challenges related to novice learners' understanding of foundational programming constructs such as variables, loops, and expressions. This research aims to develop assessment items for measuring student understanding in introductory CS classrooms in middle school using a principled approach for assessment design. This paper describes the design of assessments items that were piloted with 100 6th, 7th, 8th graders who had completed an introductory programming course using Scratch. The results and follow-up cognitive thinkalouds indicate that students are generally unfamiliar with the use of variables, and harbor misconceptions about them. They also have trouble with other aspects of introductory programming such as how loops work, and how the Boolean operators work. These findings point to the need for pedagogy that combines popular constructionist activities with those that target conceptual learning, along with better professional development to support teachers' conceptual learning of these foundational constructs.","Wes McKinney,Wes McKinney,Wes McKinney",,2017
10.1109/scam.2017.12,,,How do Scratch Programmers Name Variables and Procedures,"Research shows the importance of selecting good names to identifiers in software code: more meaningful names improve readability. In particular, several guidelines encourage long and descriptive variable names. A recent study analyzed the use of variable names in five programming languages, focusing on single-letter variable names, because of the apparent contradiction between their frequent use and the fact that these variables violate the aforementioned guidelines.,,In this paper, we analyze variables in Scratch, a popular block-based language aimed at children. We start by replicating the above single-letter study for Scratch. We augment this study by analyzing single-letter procedure names, and by investigating the use of Scratch specific naming patterns: spaces in variable names, numerics as variables and textual labels in procedure names.,,The results of our analysis show that Scratch programmers often prefer longer identifier names than developers in other languages, while Scratch procedure names have even longer names than Scratch variables. For the single-letter variables, the most frequent names are x, y, and i. Single-letter procedures are less popular, but show more tendency to be in upper case. When compared to the other programming languages, the usage of single uppercase letters in Scratch variables seems to be similar to the pattern found in Perl, while for the lowercase letters—to the pattern found in Java. Concerning Scratch specific features, 44% of the unique variable names and 34% of the projects in the dataset include at least one space. The usage of textual labels between parameters in procedure names appears as not common, however textual patterns used imply an influence from textual languages, for example by using brackets.,,Previous research indicate the identifier names as one significant issue in transitioning from visual block-based to textual programming languages. The naming patterns we found support this claim for Scratch programmers who may incur difficulties when transitioning to the use of mainstream textual programming languages. Those languages restrict the use of spaces in identifiers and more often divert into short and single-letter names—tendencies opposite to the naming preferences in Scratch.",Wil M.

10.1007/978-3-319-71483-7_17,,,Real-Time Data Analyses in Secondary Schools Using a Block-Based Programming Language,"Data management is central to many CS innovations: Smart home technologies and the Internet of Things, for example, are based on processing data with high velocity. One of the most interesting topics emphasizing several challenges in this field is real-time data analysis. In secondary CS education, it is only considered marginally. So far, there are no tools suitable for general-purpose real-time data analysis in school. In this paper, we discuss this topic from a secondary CS education perspective. Besides central concepts and differences to traditional data analysis using relational databases, we describe the development of a general-purpose \(\textsf {Snap}{\textit{!}}\) extension that allows accessing and processing data from various sources. Thereby, students are enabled to conduct data analyses using, for example, sensor data or web APIs. With the example of a weather station, we outline how this tool can be used in school for analyzing sensor data generated in the classroom.","Wu-Yuin Hwang,Rustam Shadiev,Chin-Yu Wang,Chin-Yu Wang,Zhi-Hua Huang",,2017

Considerable efforts worldwide suggest the need for more empirical studies providing evidence-based practices to introduce and engage children with coding activities. The main goal of this study is to examine which programming concepts students use when they want to develop a game, and what is the interrelation among these concepts. To achieve our goal, a field study was designed and data were collected from coding activities. In detail, during a two-week period, one-day workshops were organized almost every day on which 44 children participating in, with ages between 8–17. The workshops follow a constructionist approach and comprise of two parts. First the children interact with robots, and then develop a game using Scratch. The findings provide a deeper understanding on how children code by showing the use of specific programming concepts to develop their projects and their correlations. Hence, we improve our knowledge about children's competences in coding.","Xinyu Fu,Chengjiu Yin,Atsushi Shimada,Hiroaki Ogata,Hiroaki Ogata",,2018

10.1016/j.future.2018.10.057,,,Clickstream for learning analytics to assess students’ behavior with Scratch,"Abstract   The construction of knowledge through computational practice requires to teachers a substantial amount of time and effort to evaluate programming skills, to understand and to glimpse the evolution of the students and finally to state a quantitative judgment in learning assessment. The field of learning analytics has been a common practice in research since last years due to their great possibilities in terms of learning improvement. Both, Big and Small data techniques support the analysis cycle of learning analytics and risk of students’ failure prediction. Such possibilities can be a strong positive contribution to the field of computational practice such as programming. Our main objective was to help teachers in their assessments through to make those possibilities effective. Thus, we have developed a functional solution to categorize and understand students’ behavior in programming activities based in Scratch. Through collection and analysis of data generated by students’ clicks in Scratch, we proceed to execute both exploratory and predictive analytics to detect patterns in students’ behavior when developing solutions for assignments. We concluded that resultant taxonomy could help teachers to better support their students by giving real-time quality feedback and act before students deliver incorrectly or at least incomplete tasks.","Yihan Lu,I-Han Hsiao",Future Generation Computer Systems,2019
10.1145/3311927.3323152,,,Is My Game OK Dr. Scratch?: Exploring Programming and Computational Thinking Development via Metrics in Student-Designed Serious Games for STEM,"Computational thinking (CT) is key to digital literacy and helps develop problem-solving skills, which are fundamental in modern school. As game design shows potential for teaching CT, metrics like Dr. Scratch emerge that help scholars systematically assess the CT of student-designed games, particularly with Scratch. Compared to other CT metrics, Dr. Scratch scores the CT of Scratch projects automatically and can be used to describe CT development. However, previous research using Dr. Scratch summatively assessed CT, but did not look at CT development. We use Dr. Scratch to assess the CT development of Scratch games designed by 8th-grade students in STEM curricula. We show how CT proficiency in student-designed games develops differently in each CT dimension, where parallelism, synchronization, and logic develop proficiently, while developing abstraction seems hard. We discuss insights into game-based CT development for STEM, and suggest improvements for metric-based CT assessment.","Yihan Lu,I-Han Hsiao",,2019
,,,Longitudinal think aloud study of a novice programmer,"Recent research from within a neo-Piagetian perspective proposes that novice programmers pass through the sensorimotor and preoperational stages before being able to reason at the concrete operational stage. However, academics traditionally teach and assess introductory programming as if students commence at the concrete operational stage. In this paper, we present results from a series of think aloud sessions with a single student, known by the pseudonym “Donald”. We conducted the sessions mainly over one semester, with an additional session three semesters later. Donald first manifested predominately sensorimotor reasoning, followed by preoperational reasoning, and finally concrete operational reasoning. This longitudinal think aloud study of Donald is the first direct observational evidence of a novice programmer progressing through the neo-Piagetian stages.","Yoav Benjamini,Yosef Hochberg",Science & Engineering Faculty,2014
